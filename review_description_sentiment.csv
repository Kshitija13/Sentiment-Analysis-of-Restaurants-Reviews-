,
"Steam momos are really tasty and affordable if certain offers are applied,but giving 4 stars because chicken soup should be provided with steam momos",1
,
wow momo is such a branded company and the fact that they send cold and hard momos is just pure disappointing. Clearly the momos were fried a long time ago and I turned out to be the unlucky customer placing order when they were thinking of disposing their old food.,0
,
"Wow Momo is Always Wow..... I am Momo Lover and my 1st choice is ""Wow Momo"". Taste is no doubt Amazing.. Keep it up. Thank You.",1

seal was broken.. it was not convincing to seal only in plastic but not in the box.,0
,
"i specifically mentioned to give green and red sauces , they gave neither",0
,
Moburg was very tasty. No need for any sauce it dip. it's already spicy and tasty.,1
,
"This outlet located at Mall of India (Food Court) serves variety of Steam, Pan Fried Momos, fried, Tandoori Momos, MoBurger.. I tried their -. ? Corn n Cheese Fried Momo. ? Chicken Momo . ? Chicken Momo Burger. ? Veggie Sizzler Momo . . Quality is superb but their taste was average. Quantity is too less as compare to price.

Now I have to cook to fill my belly. I request the restaurant to check the order before it’s sealed and handed over for delivery. The delivery agent was spectacular and even confirmed that was the package he received and went out of his to recheck and confirm. The moburgs were excellent.",0
,
"I have ordered for vegetarian combo , but received a chicken combo. As soon as realised that it’s not vegetarian . I raised my issue with zomato. Zomato called the restaurant and raised the issue , but restraunt Confirmed that it was vegetarian. I have all the pictures and video that shows tht it’s chicken.. I am a vegetarian , and because of their neglegance I had non veg.. it’s a religious issue… i would love to take a legal action again this restaurant.",0

IF YOU ORDER ONLINE THEY NEVER PROVIDE YOU THE GREEN CHUTNEY.,0

Having a piece of hair in momos. The burger is Unhygienic food And unhealthy,0

Very bad experience,0

Extremely bad taste with less quantity. Momos aren't worth of so much money and the street momos are so good than this.. But no doubt chicken portion in Momos are good enough. So 2 Star only. . Taste is good but so much chilly in the Schezuan Sauce. I would suggest to make at your own. Sorry Wow Momos,0

Hygiene was poor as we found hair in our food,0

the restaurant delayed in preparation of food. please take care of this. If this continues I won't order anything from that restaurant,0

Steam momos was average in taste. some of the momos were punctured and the stuffing came out of it. Rest items were good. I think you should work after the steam momos. They were unsatisfactory.,0

D Chef is Good.. Little bit less Spicy for Tomato Garlic would helped...Thanks Chef fr d Burger..Loved it...,1

Momo was really good taste but chilly sauce or chutney was bad due to bad smell which we can’t eat it. Please make sure to deliver the fresh chutney.,0

The darjeeling momos were great.  But the best thing was that the entire package was sealed tight with zomato tapes. This would prevent the chances of missing food items due to delivery boy ! I am satisfied with the service.,1

Momos : very bad,0

ordered supreme momo. delivered mix of supreme + Darjeeling momos because Darjeeling momos do not sell due to prominent garlic taste. don't be surprised if you ordered a veg momo and end up getting chicken momos because they haven't sold out for the day. See pic for proof.,0

Wow Momo has become a brand which we all trust blindly for safe quality and consistent taste. . But some how quality control has now gone for a toss. This brand cannot be relied upon now especially for delivery and days when they run offers.,1

We ordered Cheese Corn Steamed Momo. It was good in taste but have very little cheese in it. It has only cheesy flavour with the corn. The sauce was a bit spicy but it went well with the momos. But the price is too high for this kind of momo. If the momo was full of cheese and corn then it's fine. But it was too high for this kind of momo.,0

"I don't even want to rate one star. My and friends and me, in total three of us ordered three different things and one item that is the steam darjeeling chicken momo was not there. I called up the restaurant and asked what to do. They said to either go and collect or else send the delivery guy. My question is, if I would go to take the dish then why would I order home delivery, wouldn't we all go to the restaurant for dine in? Even to refund it is difficult they said as it was a meal and that too taken in offer. But at least I feel they could have tried delivering themselves or divide the 99 rupes in the meal and refund, because the mistake was from thier side. The packet was properly sealed and had no damages whatsoever so the mistake is not from the delivery guy. We really felt bad as we wanted to have three kinds of dishes &amp; share and eat.. To be honest the food that I recieved was okay, but maybe because of this bad experience the food that we had also felt dull. Hope they do not do this in future to anyone.. ",0

"This is my review based on over all outlets I have visited, including this Panjim outlet. All the time I never get steamed Momos and it's not available I donno what's the reason but there has to be a huge reason which I would love to know as to why everytime I am not getting steam Momo",

I had ordered for two combos of chicken steam momos and a moburg but instead got 2 combos delivered where it consisted of 4 pieces each. Also the sauce also tasted weird. Highly disappointed with the inefficiency of the restaurant for delivering correct orders. Please improve your services.,

Not going to order again from them. Upon asking to keep mayonnaise, they simply refused, and asked 30rs for that. Dude, I can get an entire bottle of Mayo for 60-70rs, why will I spend 30rs for just a spoon of Mayo!. . Suitable only for people who eat fiery food.",

The quality of wah momo has fallen to a new low in such a way that the roadside momo tastes better than this. Really horrible and a nightmare to consume such a worthless momo at such exorbitant prices along with huge taxes in addition. The founder of wah momo sud himself taste the same to understand where these franchises are taking this brand to a negative direction. It's a genuine feedback and take this on serious note. Thnx.,

Very much salty..and was not fresh…making people fool by charging this much… i threw after having 1 or 2,
,
food package was torned with spillage,
,
received wrong order,
,
First and most probably the last mistake ordering from this outlet.,
,
bakwass chatni me no taste,
,
hi . we got delivery  2.30 minutes late. food is not good as expected as it's very cold condition,
,
order is very late.guy who delivered order is very arrogant,
,
I ordered 2 veg momo and 2 moburg recd only 1 of each,
,
crazy momo jod burger ??,
,
Mind Blowing,
,
The momo sauce provided was old and smelling. . The momos were well prepared and hot.,
,
I am really happy with wow momo nice taste of momo,
,
No sauce given,
,
All of the foods are very tasty ??.,
,
in momos i got mostly ginger taste and the restaurant did not send the spicy chutney,
,
i got my momo and burger with out any sauce.. and its not even hot.,
,
very worst too spicy and burger taste very worst and no mayonnaise ...,
,
"i was sent a chicken moburg, even though I am a vegetarian. this is simply unacceptable",
,
quantity was not appropriate as compared to other outlets....chicken pieces were scarce.,
,
The momos were not good. The chutney was horrible,
,
Delivery was on time .Behaviour of Delivery boy was very polite &amp; decent,
,
Wow moment create by wow momo team.paneer steem momo test wow.keep it up.thanks for service.good job,
,
the Zomato delivery valet was very polite and professional. delivered my order safely despite of a lot of communication errors. very satisfied with the delivery valet's service,
,
less quantity as per price,
,
Good,
,
very bad quality . not good taste,
,
Delivery boy is too good ??,
,
"Overall, This was the first instance that quality of food was not such great for which it was known. I had ordered momos and burger several times but this was the worst one and bad experience. Hopefully, you will review my complaint and do the needful.",
,
waste taste ??,
,
"no mayonnaise, momo tasted worst than a Street momo",
,
it was not even warm,
,
Please decrease the overall price if you want more people to order again and again. 570 rupees for 20 momos is way too much and wasn't worth it at all.,
,
wow,
,
good,
,
Taste was good but green chatni was missing. Even the Red chilli chatni was not sufficient.,
,
Incorrect product delivered to me,
,
The moburgs did not have momos inside them. They had patties and the taste was horrible.,
,
Very disappointed.,
,
The cheese chicken Momo was opened,
,
Overpriced with no tastes!!,

Not a good experience with Wow Momo !!!  Too much overpriced items !!  Quality and quantity is poor also.,

,
the best momos and burger combo ever.. must try,
,
I find it very annoying that there is no chilli oil/momo chutney accompaniment no matter how much you order. No momo portion is complete without that. Period. Why are you guys trying to rip off customers by not even sending one portion of sauce per box of momos? I feel cheated by your unnecessary greed.,

The quality of wah momo has fallen to a new low in such a way that the roadside momo tastes better than this. Really horrible and a nightmare to consume such a worthless momo at such exorbitant prices along with huge taxes in addition. The founder of wah momo sud himself taste the same to understand where these franchises are taking this brand to a negative direction. It's a genuine feedback and take this on serious note. Thnx.,

So visited this place which has seating option.. Ordered for tandoori momos to which the attendant said it would take around 10mins.. But be aware that u cant even enter the seating area before paying for your order.. We waited for around 35 mins for our order. In 277rs you get 5 pieces of tandoori momos which are not tandoori cuz they are not made in tandoor as they dont even have tandoor. Taste was not good. It was bland. Would not recommend momos from this place and would surely appreciate if they could improve their in house service or rather dont keep seating options only.,

very nice and very testy I love wow momo . jhinku wwwwwwwwwowwwwwww,
,
wow momos ki jagah ' Chii Momos ' naam rkhlo . totally money waste.,
,
Filling was stale and uncooked.. The momos were too small and lacked the taste to justify the price,
,
Packaging was too bad... Everything inside burgers got messed up &amp; uneatable,
,
Most of momos are burnt from down and full of oil filled.. it’s worst experience,
,
steamed momos are better than fried momos.. deal of 99 was good,
,
"five reach &amp; healthy staffs, super delicious?.......",
,
"overall quality of the food was very dissatisfactory. it was not warm at all, which was not supposed to be so in 30 minutes. the 7up was also very hot. ",
,
very bed quality swear chatni also kharab very disappointing,
,
Only 5  momos  very low quality momos pls dont do order,
,
I ordered veg momos and they sent me a Non-Veg momos.. . I would suggest them to check what they are sending before dispatching the order!,
,
"Poor taste,less quantity,it was a waste of money.The quantity of momos waa too less.Will avoid ordering from here again.",
,
wrong product received..non veg when i ordered veg momos,
,
delay in delivery.... momos was not hot. bad services,
,
this is the first time I ordered the combo...for rs 99 on the zomato offers..was not expecting 5 momos in it..and that too this big..was filling ..could not even finish it all. burger was yummy.. something different than normal orders..pepsi goes absolutely well with these treats..all in all great filling tasky one time meal??,
,
Paneer momos's outer layer was broken with filling spilling outside. Chicken momos had way too much black pepper in them,
,
I ordered 2 combo but recieved only 1 . When I raised the issue to Zomato the restaurant refused to take any action and didn't even answer the phone. Very rude language and behaviour. Worst.,
,
"Uncooked chicken steamed momos , completely bland.Never ordering again.",
,
"I ordered darjeeling momo x2 , corn &amp; cheese fried momo and stir fried cheese momo. The entire order was just perfect.",
,
meyo dips not provided.only chilli dip had given.,
,
"Had the Momo Burger, Veg Momos and Fried Momos here. The momos were very delicious and juicy. Also the sauce served along is tooo good. ",
,
Momos were very sticky and sour. Bad smell was coming. Didnt found fresh at all. Packaging wasn't done properly.,
,
"First of all Red sauce was having stale taste &amp; top of that Chicken fried was not Evenly fried, burger was not having sufficient sauce on it, combo was not worth of 99, road side momo are much better, thank you for great experience",
,
tastyyy??and least cost . flavourful yummy and amazing.,
,
old stock. smelly...Threw it . yakk.Will not buy again,
,
The quality of WoW Momo has dropped significantly over the last 1 year. The outer coating is hard and the filling has also lost taste.,
,
food wasn't good at all its seems  stale somewhat. no pics to upload,
,
excellent ????????????????????????????????????????????,
,
"Good food with good taste.............. Awsome...............,.......... Superb wow such me . I hope they will continue",
,
Taste was average. THERE WAS A DEAD BEE OR SOMETHING ON THE MOMO,
,
Got oy one plate of Schezwan momo instead of two as ordered.,
,
"the burger was really good. . But in case of momo, it was broken",
,
seems light oily.. serves for 1 person.. overall good.. try once,
,
Paneer was super super stale. tasted pungent. Tasted really really bad.,
,
Momo Sauce is not good at all. Rotten smell comming out from it.,
,
they are providing momos with red and green sauce.,
,
"superb food, great value for money .....Good work ",
,
"Super tasty Indian-oriental flavouring, no delights missing there. Had 3 different pan-fried chicken ones. Potential to be a standard crashing place for momo lovers.. . Although the price is quite too high for the quantity. Can do significantly better on the value/price ratio. Sad to have spent this much on momos in retro.",
,
The stuffing was tasting sour as it was prepared not fresh.,
,
get veg moburg instead of chicken moburg...it's horrible,
,
"Horrible momos I have ever had. Worst experience ever. The food was stale, the momos we re cold like put of the refrigerator, and over spicy. Highly disappointed. ",
,
at the time of order it was mentioned that ill get 4 pieces but i got only 3 pieces in each box,
,
They did not give me any source and the cold drink was burning hot,
,
the momo was very tangy in taste and mob burg was not in taste at all,
,
awesome delivery,
,
Side dip which is given for momos was smelled like vinegar. Kindly redo properly next time,
,
If you want it for yourself then It will be perfect but if you want it for four people then you will have order 2-3 sets as on set has 5 momos LOL,
,
It was fried momos but yet it was like gravy one. Taste was good but why gravy ???,
,
I got stale veg Darjeeling steam momo. and zomato couldn't help. a zomato chatbot was there to provide me mental support for my problem. ?? . panfried chicken momo was very good. . steam veg Darjeeling momo was stale. ??,
,
2nd time order its good ????????. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .,
,
"please do us afavour and mention rotten food served hot. . momo i ordered it was smelling, taste was bad. . only good thing was zomato delivery service, on time. wow momo is just garbage",
,
chatni was not given separately. it was given on the same box as of momos.. the fried momos were soft as chatni was all over it.. disgusting in taste????.,
,
Received hot meal ..so i am happy and the quality is good,
,
Taste awesome.. But no green chutney was provided with the parcel.,
,
"The momos were very tasty, but the schezwan sauce was a bit much and was overpowering the whole dish.",
,
in cooking instruction we mentioned for extra chutnies and thy just send only one chutney that too very little.And we ordered two plates also not responding on call at all.,
,
personally I don't like chocolate momo platter that much but chicken Darjeeling pan fried momo was just awesome,
,
"momo was not cooked properly, the sauce given smelled rotten",
,
Paneer momo was horrible as it was teast very bad and seems it was from yesterday or older stock,
,
"nice behavior, best ",
,
"ordered Fried, received steamed.. there is difference of Rs. 26 per plate, pls process refund of total Rs. 156 for 6 plate order",
,
"Just too yum to resist, and the packing was so attractive ?? the box packing was also so good !! . Just loved it !! ",
,
"I didn't even got what I ordered for , very bad   ",
,
??????,
,
"momos were not fried, despite the fact that it was mentioned darjeeling chicken fried momos",
,
besttttttt,
,
valet does not have ethics of communication.  and was arguing with us,
,
tasty,
,
Tried momo burger and really enjoyed the concept. Two momos stuffed in a bun and loaded with sauces. . It’s a new and tasty concept. . Can give it a try and extremely affordable,
,
Momos not cooked properly and store staff doesn’t respond the call,
,
usually i order pan fried corn n cheese momo but it was not showing in the menu list then i decided to try some new and orderd paneer pan fried momo. taste was not that good ??. corn n cheese is a must try ??,
,
Today I ordered moberg with Cheesy &amp; Mayo Dip and i received Moberg with Twitch Beverage. Please take care before dispatch.,
,
food was cold it was not just good today dono why,
,
not very great taste. okay type momos. doesn't look very fresh.. maybe kept in cold storage and reheated with steam.,
,
i have order veg momos the taste was good but over cooked stuffing is not fill properly,
,
"Always a favourite. The different options of flavours to choose from, never disappoints! Requested them to wite a small note for a friend, and they got it printed ??. Really happy with the service!",
,
the food was cold and soggy and tasted very bad,
,
momos were cold and soggy not at all crispy at all. tasted so bad,
,
"Very bad packaging... eco friendly is good but you should also consider that sending items like Thukpa in paper boxes , it would leak. so did mine.... ",
,
okjjjjjjjjjjj bnnhgvcbbbbhhccch,
,
Momo was tasty. But pudina sauce was not provided.,
,
you guys didn't deliver sauces along with momos. pathetic service,
,
plz don't give any combo offer if the food is prepared so carelessly.  momos are nt full with chicken as ur usual one that is fine. bt moburg is pathetic nothing in it between the buns.,
,
"Overall it's good, not bad ????????",
,
I want chicken momos but received veg momos. . please check the issue,
,
corn cheese is our personal favourite.,
,

,
"horrible burnt bun, missing momo inside burger, cold and stale, never ordering again",
,
package leaked. totally wet package and very very cold when received,
,
"Awesome as always, but have it hot and immediately for a soul satisfying experience.. Tastes good and better when served hot.",
,
fast delivery with genuine item,
,
They delivered cold momos………... effortlessly tasteless.??,
,
I paid full amount but received partial order. Fried momos are not good,
,
what the hell is this.,
,
Taste was good but my order was incomplete I received only one box of moms instead of 4.. disappointed,
,
"I have ordered 2 plates steamed derjeeling veg momos. i found that one plate was of non- veg momos. its really disappointing, as i am a vegetarian.",
,
late food preparation time.need to improve on that,
,
there was mosquito on my momo,
,
Today’s momos were over fried and dry. It was too chewy and not juicy as always,
,
wow,
,
the momos was messed up fully dipped in chuteny although the taste is good but they were too spicy,
,
Wooooow..... As always..,
,
sent the wrong order. totally ruined the mood for dinner.,
,
stale and poor quality. cheats customers by giving offers just to sell the left overs.,
,
Recieved my order in time! And it's really delicious,
,
the chutney is rotten completely taste is very bad,
,
Steamed momos is uncooked and fried momos is very salty.Not happy and worth,
,
don't like it there is a hair and onion skin in food..Not worth it from such big brand.,
,
no mayonnaise . cold momos. sugary chutni,
,
"i ordered for 20 momos, and then they delivered 10 momos. heinous",
,
"it was okay, not bad. In the menu, it said that green chutney and red chutney would be provided. but, this is the third time you people only gave red chutney. atleast it was more palatable and less spicy this time. Stick to your words and don't fool people by saying that you will give something when you won't. Don't leave unfulfilled promises. It's infuriating ",
,
good,
,
nice,
,
Delay to prepare,
,
Ordered for pan fried momos and a moburg and they were really good. Packaging was on point.Value for money,
,
"Corn n Cheese momos was juicy,delicious taste I love it both Sauces red sauce and green sauce taste is good overall value for money keep it up",
,
very good,
,
taste was not good.the chicken filing was too soury.,
,
Less quantity for the price.,
,
Worst restaurant to order from. They provided one less Pepsi and no green chutney was given,
,
Bun used for Moburg was not fresh but momos were fine. Moburg could have been better,
,
Chicken moburger was verrrrrrrry spicy they put tons of chilli sauce instead of ketchup.. i think restaurant need to change recipe..,
,
worst taste..see some online videos and you can mak much better,
,
Cold. Hard momos that weren’t fried properly. The chutney leaked in the box,
,
"broken momo ,, not expected ",

Average,
,
"momo s wasn't hot, delivery boy reached very late??condition of mom was like mixed ",
,
it's so much sour,
,
I had ordered pan-fried chicken cheese &amp; darjeeling chicken momos. However there was no cheese in pan fried so was not satisfied. Also there were no spoons provided with the same. Darjeeling momos were good though,
,
chicken was stale. momos were smelly. horrible quality.,
,
it's good.... packed nicely and colourful...test was yummmm,
,
They serve burned and half cooked momos,
,
worst,
,
"The fillings of momos are becoming blander and blander. Besides, the fillings are also very less in proportion to the momos. The only thing that’s good is the tomatoes chutney!",
,
taste was good but sauce can be more thicker,
,
"None spicy. no gravy, totally pathetic.. it was tasteless.. I want refund of money",
,
they was no sauce and chutney... you people are charging for this right... and it wasn't a small order..seriously disappointed yaar..,
,
poor performance,
,
food was cold. they placed the cold drink on top of the momo. how foolish.  spoiled my lunch,
,
Won’t consider ordering from wow momo anymore.,
,
it was tasty ??,
,
Items were missing. I didn't received red chutney along with momos.,
,
"Worst momos and burger i had till now, never gonna order again with WOW momos.",
,
i love wow momo.  i have always  been to outlet.  this is  first  time i ordered  at home  and worst  experience.,
,
first time tried fry momos... and oil in the momos is horrible.... unlimited oil,
,
chicken pan fried momo was not tasty much like it's use to be.,
,
Dint receive adequate sauce as per order. Just 1 pack,
,
bakwas,
,
ok,
,
Not worth momos at this price point,
,
maza nahi aaya,
,
it has spilled all over! neither Zomato helped with this order i have discarded my order because it was not consumable. . bad experience ??,
,
tax n delivery charges are very high,
,
sabji paka nhi tha....kachcha tha,
,
"the sauce given was really spicy, I wish they gave two sauces(spicy+non spicy) as they usually do in the take-out places. ",
,
due to valet food got spoiled,
,
momos were only 5 pieces.....,
,
Moburg was Yummy but the Chicken Momos were stale. I did not like the Momos!,
,

,
Delivery was very very fast . I was happy . Also taste was very good.  thank you,

,
The food was cold and taste was awful. Threw the whole food . Too bad service . Not going order from this outlet,
,
Don’t get the cheese dip,
,

,
It would be good if they make the momo sauce less spicy,
,
perfect for one,
,
It was very delicious. the chicken and cheese combination along with the Schezwan sauce was great. besides the momos were steaming ??. the fresh coriander leaves added more freshness,
,
it was spoilt,
,
item missing I ordered 2 burgers 1+1 I recved only one so refund in my account,
,
amazing taste.... . would be really amazing if they could increase the number of momos to 8 per serving.,
,
Its the worst product. The food was totally cold and the taste was also not at all good.No one should buy buy from here as because it is providing the food which has been made previously and the products which are not getting sold they used to sell those products.,
,
Good teste.. Delivary boy was polite.. Good person I personally give him 5 star also..,
,
extremely disappointed with the quality and the way they messed up the order. first they sent the wrong drinks. then they sent the wrong momos. the flavour was off big time. was dry. packages were not marked. burgers were very dry and boring. not going to order from here again,

There is only stuffing of cabbage and carrat.  some more vegetables are expected in veg momo,
,
"The food was incredible!!! Just that steamed momos packing needs to be looked into. May be u can add sections/partition coz they were glued to each other and while picking one up , the other one tore open. Apart from that .. no complaints!!!",
,
Momos were smelly and were not freshly made..seemed stale! We didn’t eat any! Everything went to dustbin,

steamed momos was not proper steamed it seems like just wrap in dough not cooked and also the chutney was smelling badly got rotten,
,
Food should be given in a proper paper bag.,
,
"To Dry, To tasteless. what's happened?",
,
Very poor. Never supply as per the order. Either mix up or miss something,
,
pan fried momo was too spicey.,
,
test not so good,
,
too costly and quantity is very less,
,
just wow...no complaints,
,
"The chilli momo is spicy. On spice level, I wud give 4/5 ( for me) . Darjaleeng momos were the saviour. Otherwise great taste and quality! ",
,
My order was incomplete as I ordered 2 plates and received just one… otherwise it good,
,
very good,
,
so chilly,
,
it was hell oily and not properly fried even. Raw and very oily.,
,
"The worst momo we have ever had. I ordered from Wow momo after ages. The quality and the taste has downgraded beyond expression post this covid era. The momos were stale, over fried, extremely oily and most importantly chewy, as if the skin of the momos were made of chewing gum. We could just consume the filling and had to throw out the covers. Not ordering again.",
,
Food was cold. Seemed to have been prepared way before. Totally disappointed with quality also.,
,

,
"The chicken pan fried momo was horrible. all the 5 momos were not just broken, but shredded. the coating was hard and tasteless. extremely disappointed. a complete waste of money. I would never order this again, nor will I recommend this to others. . Though the chicken cheese momo tasted better comparatively. ",
,

,
the food was cold,
,
There were 5 pieces of momos out of which 3 were burnt. Couldn’t eat it and had to throw it away. Wasn’t offered any help from Team Zomato as well. Highly disappointed.,
,
Ordered pan fired veg momos. No filling. Was too spicy. But the sadder thing was it 3 out of 5 had no filling,
,
the augratin was burnt,
,
How can I pay 169 rupees for 5 momos and some even broken ??,
,
The chutney was smelling bad. not a recommend outlet,
,
good but quantity less fast is excellent. packing is good,
,
"As we all know this place is best for momos .Really they make so good momos . I have tried chicken steam momos from here.

,
"I just love wow momo. I'm a fully momo person and I extremely like wow momo. I ordered several times from this outlet. And get very testy momos.

super spicy and super tasty veg Darjeeling momo.These momo are for those people who like really really spice food not for who avoid the spicy stuff it's one most tasty momos I had they were crispy and we're marinated with red hot sauce which made flavour more enhance.Talking about the packaging it was very much done on point the food was delivered hot and it was delivered by Zomato on given time .

"Detailed review on: @foodbanquet. . •Tastewise supur spicy but delicious (contains- 5piece Momos).. &amp;. • As usual, MoBurg(2) were the Best in Taste ??. Will surely ReOrder soon!. •But cons, Spice spillted out allover outside the box as it was NOT sealed &amp; so I received the package in very bad cum Unhygienic condition (though the delivery executive handled correctly).. •Definitely I didn't expect such from Wow Momo being a regular customer!",
,
They don't follow instructions.,
,
Worst packaging and it is not tamper proof also. Food quality is also not good.,
,
The taste was not aspected .. even local street momos is better then wow momos ..never recommenced..,
,
Guys i would not at all recommend you to try it.. they were so bad in taste and even so sticky really bad experience the price is all too much and its not at all worth it.. .,
,
The food qas nothing but chilly. We ordered spicy food but not that burns our mouth. horrible food,
,
Quality of momo has degraded. Vegetable was stinky &amp; Chutney was stale,
,
Please ensure freshness and health safety of your products and make them compatible with the rather high price tags,

"I was actually pretty grossed out to get a piece of hair ticked in my food. It was GROSS and ruined our appetite. Fortunately we found it before we started eating. We asked them to take back the food (it was intact, we hadn't even taken a bite) and give us our money back, which they did immediately. They didn't apologize, they were cold. Wow Momo needs to ensure that the staff maintains proper hygiene.",

"Having just come out of Darjeeling, I wanted to try Momo and see how authentic it was. As WOW! Momo was in my immediate list I went ahead and tried their Momo Meal combo which included a Chicken Momo, Chicken Thukpa, Moburg and Pepsi. I asked whether they could combine Kalakata with this. It was not as per their procedure but still they went ahead and did it. That was sweet of them. And the drink tasted excellent too.. . We also customized the Momo as Pan Fried which I didn’t like much. I didn’t like it in both the aspects, momo as well as the way it was Pan Fried. Thukpa was nice but not authentic, it has got to be blander. Anyways for South Indian tongue, this suited perfectly. Moburg, surprisingly, was amazing. The bread was super soft and the combination of momo and bread along with the sauces were so flavorful and tempting. In all a decent experience but the authenticity is questionable.",

Received  sweet corn momos Instead of mushroom fried momos,
,
I received everything in order but chocolate momo was only one piece.,
,
Cheese dip did not come in with the order,
,
It's not baked. Not able to eat,
,
Only received chicken Darjeeling momo and moburg combo. Where is fried cheese momo?,
,
I ordered steam momos,
,
I received poor quality food the size of the momos was not appropriate & chicken stuffing was not good,
,
Fried momos was soggy. Did not seem fried at all,
,
Only one sauce is given for two plate momos..really disappointed,

After calling delivery person repeatedly, he picked up saying he is bringing food again. My food was delivered 1.5 hours later all cold &amp; guests had left without eating.

wow momo is my favorite but the taste and quality of the chutney is decreasing day by day. it's very disheartening that a brand like wow momo will have this kind of fault,
,
it is very soggy,

The resturant is charging 18% GST on food where as the prescribed rate for food is 5%. They are giving some wired excuse like the momos are centrally manufactured and the outlet is only selling it (which is totally a false statement as there is a kichen just besides the counter). Further the HSN  code 2106 against which they are charging the 18% GST is not mentioned in the bill. This is a serious violation of the rule and the resturant should be punished for this type of practice.,

,
fabulous,
,
"delivery executive is good, but i didnt like the food.",
,
Usually I found of non veg momos but tried the paneer and Darjeeling momos and to my surprise they were lit . ???? Ample amount of stuffings totally worth it and the best part is they are pocket friendly.,

wow momo delivers vry late ita 30min late,
,
THEY ARE DUPING EVERYONE BY GIVING INCOMPLETE ORDERS AND THEN DON'T EVEN PICK UP THE CALL TO RESOLVE. DONT ORDER FROM HERE.,
,
Momos were good . Chutney is changed a lot and can be much better . Garlic chutney goes well,
,
supar test,

They forgot to send the momo’s chutney,
,
Very oily..,

,
chicken is not soft or juicy.. kind of dry.. Don't like it,
,
The best platter if you love Chocolate as well as Momos?,
,
Packaging was not good. The drinks got hot because it was kept with the food  and no napkins were provided,
,
Delivery was very fast and delivery guy was very well mannered and  we'll spoken!,
,
The momo was HORRIBLE. Sour and very very salty.  The worst momos ever. It was supposed to be a gift for my family after my first salary. Wow momo simply spoiled everything,
,
The momo was absolutely rubbish .....Got upset stomach after eating....Not recommend any one to buy such worst food item ....wow momo sodepur is the worst......,
,
The moburg was completely burnt and it's taste was very bitter. Did not like it at all. This food was not expected.,

"I ordered fried momo, got steamed momo, very bad experience ",
,
Ordered Darjeeling chicken pan fried. The most amazing momos I've ever had.,
,
packaging is awesome but there are no soup if soup is added to this then it has 10 out 10,
,
"spicy sauce was too thin,water was added to the sauce,Coldrink was not at all cold,should be not kept with hot items as well. Wow momo needs to pay attention to this. I am paying extra charges for the service.",
,
the momos were very much oily and the burger was a bit cold seemed that it was prepared long ago while the coke was totally warm,
,
"The delivered package was crushed and sauce along with momos were out of the box for all the 3 momos pack!. . It can be a delivery issue but i am very disappointed with the order although zomato claims they were delivering via PRO DELIVERY.. . . Please take care of deliveries as well.. . At the end if delivered food is not in a good shape to eat, the order becomes useless for the customer as well.. . Hope zomato will consider this feedback  seriously !!",
,
the paneer momo was a disaster. the outer part was so hard to chew. we got sick after having two of it. improve the quality.,
,
Very fresh and tasty it was. Specially the Moburgs,
,
Worst food. Gave 1 star because there is no option lesser than this. Waste of money. Burger was not at all fresh. Pls do not order from this restaurant.,
,
momos were too oily . rest chicken momos were fine.,
,
they do not follow cooking instructions . and zomato will never provide you good support . so dont waste your money,
,
1. Horrible packaging. . 2. Don’t bother about ordering drinks because they will charge you and won’t deliver it to you. Reporting to Zomato won’t be of any use because they will keep on insisting that your full order was delivered.,
,
pathetic taste. quality has severely been affected . tasted stale,
,
packing was not good and order was also delayed and food was not good but it was bad too,
,
some of the pieces were stale .. not expected with wow momos,
,
I ordered chicken steamed momos also but didn’t get it. I paid for the complete order. This is not done,
,
The momos were stale and even the chatni had ketchup mixed. This did not seems to be from Wow momos,
,
Yelahanka outlet is excellent . they sent freshly made green chutney and red chutney which was great combo with fried momo taste is amazing.. one of my moburg was crushed as Pepsi was put on it.. nonetheless I love this restaurant and recommend to all. they also sent a raw tomato chutney which doesn't go well with momo,
,
missed pepsi ans chilly sauce... please send items according to the order,
,
Not fresh…short delivered and then delivered the balance…usual style of wow Momos.,
,
muh me kirkari (signifies bad quality goods) aa ri hai,
,
The food was cold and bland. There was no mayonnaise to go with momos.,
,
Not satisfied with the experience.. The ordered kind was different from what was delivered.. Disappointed a bit this time,
,
again no green chutney sent! inspite of it BEING PART OF THE ORDER. AND MY REMINDING YOU GUYS TO SEND. AND YOU GUYS CONFIRMING IT. NEVER ORDERING FROM YOU GUYS AGAIN.,
,
the food was too much oily that spoiled its taste and i have to throw away the meal. my 250 rupees were wasted. never go with wow momos,
,
They mix yesterday food..some are smelling..we r not able to eat.,
,
it was delivered fast but i don't understand why it is so cold,
,
Amazing taste. . Actually amazed buy the taste of Wow momos. Best place to have Momos. . Lots of variety in momos.. Momo lovers should definitely visit.,
,
"chillid momos we received, have you ever tried chilled momos ",
,
burnt burger...just not expected from wow momo...it's terrible,
,
"Recently tried this outlet as my friend suggested me, but i personally did not liked the taste of Momo's here.. . I tried - Corn and Chilli Momo and Veg pan fried momos. It was not up to the mark. Did not enjoyed having it and not worthy too. It was expensive as well.. . Quantity was very less and was not sufficient enough for 2 of us. If i compare this place to others then i will surely prefer having momos from other outlets. Presentation was also not so good.. . All in all, it was not a good time having meal here.",
,
just wowww food ???? delivery boy behaviour is so decent ??,
,
ordered 3 different variety of momos but cutlery and sauces were sent as per 1 portion,
,
moburg was half burnt and inedible.. rest all ok.,
,
Totally disgusting. foul smell. Don't  order here again just for 99,
,
"chicken hakka noodles is not good , try something else",
,
food was really amazing but I didn't get any Dips for Momos ??,
,
Too much spicy please issue refund all food is wasted.,
,
It was perfect in taste. I would deffinetly recommend it.,
,
Ordered the newly launched chilli momos From wow momos and they were really amazing.. A completely different taste,
,
too cheese and sweet momo should be spicy I didn't like it,
,
"expired coke, no chutney. i dont know why cant they chdck before delivering",
,
taste is not as expected and took more than half an hour just to prepare my food it was nearly 40 mins,
,
Only 3 boxes were delivered out of 4. Very disappointed.,
,
We have ordered three Corn Cheese Pan Fried Momos but instead We got two of the ordered items and one plain normal Momos. Zomato should penalise the vendor for serving wrong dishes,
,
package was littered from one end which made to flow,
,
food is rotten its tastes that the food is not good,
,
very bad experience.momos are not fresh. smells badly. yak!????????????,
,
the chicken was hard to chew and the momo itself was pretty thick.,
,
"No momo sauce/chutney received. Not sure for what and why they are charging such a premium cost for veg (cabbage, carrot, beans) dumplings/momos. Without momo sauce this cannot be eaten. Very bad..",
,
The Momo was not good by its quality . It was not good by taste also,
,
Received broken pieces. No chutneys inside. And entirely cold and blatant.,
,
"Was not tasty as usually wow mono has,even sauce.. ",
,
no fresh  moms smell heavy no fresh red chutney other no moyune and green chutney very bad experience no value for money .,
,
taste are awesome as usual but sizes of momos r become small you should improve ur size,
,
The momos are extremely spicy. Nevertheless they were good.,
,
Momos are my personal favourite food.....had heard a lot about this place but was dissapointed with the taste....was not cooked properly....price to taste ratio is very low,
,
quantity is bit less but taste is mind-blowing.Completely blown away!,
,
Momos could have been more juicy than solid. Taste was missing this time.,
,
stale chicken... not expected from wow momo... total waste of money... demand for refund.,
,
The momos are stale and the chutney is completely spoiled...,
,
Third class momos full of black fungus on packets. Killing people in such epidemic times with such carelessness. Very bad experience. Stale material.??,
,
worst packaging!! It's not enough to keep flexing lightning fast deliveries when the food comes in this condition,
,
there was stone inside it. how could I take the pic of mouth,
,
I have ordered something else they have delivered something else,
,
good,
,
"5 pieces of burnt, oily and badly stuffed momos is what you get for 250 bucks at this pathetic place... plz avoid for your own good..",
,
wow momo gave me expired pepsi. But the burger was tasty.,
,
"momos were good, packing was nice but momos skin was peeled off because the skin was very thin",
,
please add mayo from next time,
,
My mother is delighted with fresh hot and tasty momo,
,
"Wow Momo has memories engraved in me which compelled me to try them out in the country's capital region. This is a standard Wow Momo outlet, with all smiling servers and clean dining space.. . I ordered Combo of Chicken Cheese Momo which contains 3 Momos, a Moburg and a small bottle of Pepsi. The Momos tasted good, nothing out of the ordinary to add; the Moburg was okayish and did not taste that great.. . Overall, it was nice to connect to my hometown taste but did not quite felt the connection I was expecting.. . Kind Note to the Management: I experienced the restaurant staffers violently kick and beat up a street dog that was not even trying to enter the outlet. This is something which needs to be looked after and proper training needs to be administered.",

it was really awesome nd I loved it.. ???,

Pan fried momo was too good. Tastes yummy. Great Quality. Wow Momo is always on top while ordering momo.,

I wish the same things happens At the store.. then I would see what explanation they give.. . #Fraud #ZOMATO",

Too much sourness..Not fresh chicken,

Great place to be and do try the new veg Chilli momo for spicy lovers and thanks to Qadir for his hospitality .,

,
it was horrible taste now I won't order again from wow,
,
Wow Momo! is the best restaurant to enjoy your favorite Momos. The staff is also very good and definitely takes care of your concern if there are any. The food is also perfectly cooked and the quality is just too good. very happy with the experience from this restaurant.,
,
"Wow momos you guys already charging too much price for your food, kindly increase the quantity so the value is justified",
,
it's not good waste of money,

,
the Coke was warm,
,
the delivery boy was very late and yet he was arguing,
,
they are not serving all the items that is mentioned in the website.,
,
The chutney that they give is tooo bad.. It looks like unblended red chillies.. Plus almost all the momos had burst open. Utterly disappointed for the price.,
,
excellent delivery service and good food ????,
,
it's really good hope to get more items from you guys,
,
Every single piece was shattered into pieces and wasn't warm at all,

Taste Is Good Yummy ??,
,
rotten chicken momo. chicken and maida both rotten and stincking horribly.,
,
the outlet did not provide any sauce or napkins. not expected,
,
good,
,
I had horrible experience with them. Ordered steamed Darjeeling chicken momos and they turned out to be stale and stinky. The flour coating was sour and chicken inside was rotten. Being extremely hungry i consumed 2 momos and suffered stomach upset for 3 days. Particularly this garia outlet is pathetic.,
,
wanted to rate the Chocolate momo negative. gave 2stars because of the generous amount of chocolate syrup.  also instead of putting real brownies which you have mentioned in the description you put sooji ka halwa mixed with coco powder. really? you think customers are that fool??,
,
"The packaging is completly bad, it's leaking kindly make sure that the packing is good next time",
,
the chicken was smelly. it was stale. highly dissatisfied with wow momo,
,
The momos were very nice and the service was really too quick,
,
It was tasteless and the chutney was very bad,
,
The chicken was absolutely stale and was stinking..we could not have even one bite of either the momos or the burger..we paid 328 Rs for such rotten food..I need full refund for this order.,
,
"They sent non veg momos instead of veg momos, can’t believe such a mistake could be made. Just sucks, wont order ever again!!!",
,
the momos were all soury in taste..... they felt stale ......,
,
very less mayanose and cheese not added the cost is too high,
,
order delayed. can you please make sure order is dispatched on time,
,
all chutney and momos spilled over total damage,
,
taste was very average. stuffing were veryry plain with cabbage and onion only .,
,
Moburg were damage,
,
Taste used to be better.,
,
You send broken all the spoiled momos when you guys send for delivery ????,
,
There was no green chutney which I’ve received in my previous orders. Red chutney is super spicy and veg momo was smelling badly. My money is wasted,
,
Momos is something which I crave anytime I would recommend wow momos for the same. . I ordered pan fried chicken momos- deep fried crunchy stuffed and cooked to perfect. This momo was just heart filling to have.. . Quality- good.. Quality- good. Recommended- yes,
,
worst taste,
,
"One of those Momo craving days when I realized they deliver to my location. I could term Wow Momos as the fast food version and obviously not the gourmet version of Momos option. . . Tried a load of different momos from the customer favourite steamed Chicken momos, steam Darjeeling to even unusual Paneer and veg momos. Would always go for their basic ones as one cannot go wrong here!!  ",
,
please make a mark of veg and non veg,
,
"Bad packaging, spilled food delivered. Bad taste. Will avoid ordering from wow momos",
,
I had Steam Darjeeling Chicken &amp; Pepsi 250ml. Didn't Pepsi give any ?? The shop is not good,
,
"Supreme steamed momo were smaller than little finger, such sized momo should not have costed more than half of what is charged.. . Darjeeling steamed momo was amazing, big sized, chutney was super tasty ",
,
it was too spicy... even though selected tomato garlic. Though the portion was good,
,
I give advise to increase the quantity.,
,
Super spicy. Can’t bear that spicy taste. Also the person delivered after 1 hour. I was almost In a cry state when the delivery boy arrived.. Really want the refund.,
,
Very bad experience..They don't deliver proper order ??,
,
"Havn't received the food, delivery person number is switched off",
,
I have ordered twice from here and both times they have given less quantity. Either a bunch of illiterates are sitting there or they are purposefully trying to cheat people. It is very irritating!,
,
good,
,
thank???? wow momo,
,
"Wrong order was delivered to me. I am a pure vegetarian and I got something non- vegetarian which I don't even know hot to describe and my whole family was so agitated and annoyed to see something non-veg. This is ridiculous and totally unacceptable as we strictly follow norms about no non-veg food. I tried calling the restaurant and they did not answer the call. The delivery boy told me to connect to restaurant but that did not happen.. Basically I was stranded and nowhere to go.. Really looking forward for some compensation apart from part refund that was processed that would make up for this. . Yours,. Unsatisfied customer who was pro member for more than 36 months and will definitely think again before buying anything from Wow Momo again.",
,
"Fresh n Hot, Right balance of spices, correct steamed",
,
I have received a non veg order instead of veg. Pathetic service,
,
WOW momos never disappoints!,
,
Poor se upar ...even not eatable food what they sent,
,
items are always missing now a days. what's the point of serving momo without chilli sauce??,
,
Momos were good but didn’t sent sauces with the food..Check ur order before giving it to delivery guy…,
,
delivery boy behaviour is good,
,
Momos were stinking and taste was sour quality was very bad,
,
"All momos were too much oily , not possible to eat by anyone . Have to throw away all of them",
,
excellent,
,
"Yesterday I ordered half corn cheese momo, I really like the way which it had designed on the plate the taste was so yummy and staff was so friendly and supportive, thanks all the employees of wow momo who become by day... ",
,
didn't taste fresh.,
,
momos are over cooked and burnt. Burger is typical in taste,
,
"Waste of money , if you order veg .. ",
,
thanks..,
,
I wanty money back.,
,
steam momo ta puro gola chilo??,
,
packing not well,
,
unethical liers wowmomo.Gave one plate less amd zomato and wow momo both said they gave all four.,
,
The momos taste very stale. it's like the staff heated old momos and sent it for delivery.,
,
not good,
,

,
It was totally not worth it of as it was too oily and chutney the red one was very bad. Momos was really bad vwry oily and no taste.,
,
Momos are good in test ambiance is good. Momo burger is nice. Chilli momos must try. Service given by people was good.,
,
Momos are good in test and order is properly delivered. Everyone should try. All instructions are followed by staff.,
,
Super tasty......... I ordered chicken steam momos full of stuffing and I cant believe its super delicious fully satisfied.,
,
"You say Momos? We hear WOW! MOMOS ??. . Treat for your mouth, serving excellent MOMO both veg and non veg. Staff is friendly and willing to assist and recommend. Price range 100-150 per plate. Quality is excellent. Recommended quick food and Momo Lovers can't miss having their Favorite momos from. WOW! MOMOS ??",
,

,
maybe stop sending burnt food and stale food... we are after all paying you and it just feels bad to have spoilt food after paying and then waiting for food after a hectic work schedule.,
,
It was not hot,
,
They can improve momo outer cover and sauce,
,
I ordered veg and non-veg momo non veg was good but the veg one is stale. I am really disappointed with wow momo.,
,
sause not given.  without sause it is difficult to eat,
,
I went to Pacific Mall. There I tried Veg Steam Momos and Paneer Stream Momos.. The taste is authentic and the church is there because of the veggies inside the momo.. I liked the spicy red chutney. It's yumm.. But having only 5 momos in a plate is less.. Overall a must try atleast once to enjoy the lovely taste.,
,
Slightly delayed delivery but enjoyable momos overall. Delivery boy very polite.,
,
wrong food delivered. I had ordered veg meal and instead non veg food was delivered.,
,
"Wonderful momos, delectable and decent quantity as well! Keep it up",
,
The delivery boy behaviour was excellent..helping nature...we need this type of people in society...Thank u so much bhai..,

first time experience is very bad.momos are over boiled layet quality very poor,
,
momos became somewhat soggy due to the delivery time taken.,
,
I usually order my momos from here. My favourite are Chicken Darjeeling steam momos and Chicken Momo Burger. I love spicy food so loved their Chutney and burger. If you are not a spicy food lover then carefully dip that momos in the chutney.?? Overall a nice experience.,
,
stale and yuck.,
,
chutney was bad,
,
Please add veg steamed momos to the menu,
,
Bad stuff . Throwing away. Came 40 mins late,
,
momos were cold bas if were not steamed before sending,

How they made that type testy foods under budget I really don't know.  Thanks to the workers team of this restaurant.,

Momos of this restaurant are very much tasty and good?? in quality. And prices are also affordable. So you can order from here definitely,

Corn &amp; Cheese Pan Fried Momo was delicious . The price was very affordable . Very fast delivery service provided by them ??,

pathetic service. on the name of discount did not maintain tha quality and forgot do deliver sauce with the momos. in which world restaurant don't give any sauce with momos. momos were not fresh and hot. Done try to make ppl full with your pathetic offers and cannot maintain the quality.,
,
no sauce no cutlery got dew instead of pepsy teste also not up to the mark,
,
"let me tell you what Zomato is up to; they have this lucrative offer: anything @99 offer. I love Wow momos but in this offer they made the filling half of the usual, cutting on costs there. So, it was more of the outer layer than the filling and just ruined the experience for me. Cheap tricks both by Zomato and Wow momos to be complicit in this.",
,
They never send sauce with the momo… it tastes horrible without momo sauce,
,
nice,
,
"it was too oily ,seems as not fried properly ",
,
"The burger was nice with a Lot of Mayonnaise and sauces, but the momos were so plain from inside i.e. just plain chicken no veggies inside for some more taste. Although nice food Good for evening snacks ??",
,
good one,
,
"wow momos being my favourite, today's experience made it chalked out of my list forever. The quality was not at all upto the mark, fried mom's were literally drenched in oil. I really had a very bad time eating the momos.",
,
Simply excellent,
,
they didn't gave the momos chutney....,
,
"Zomato, please start delivering orders on time and when you are charging a premium of delivery charges than please deliver it the it was supposed to. Do not add 2 orders for delivery in single order. It spoils the taste as it takes a long time to deliver. Plus I beg of you to stop charging robbing fees in the name of taxes and packing. When store doesn’t. Its another way of looting people.",

The flavors were very strong and momos were a little crisp. 3. Darjeeling chicken steam momos: the filling was average and slightly bland. The coating of the momos was too thick. There was a stink in the momos, maybe it was because the meat was undercooked or maybe stale. . 4. Moburg: nothing but a waste of money. You can only taste the bun and sauces. . Overall won't recommend if you want to have authentic momos. Quality was average. ",

The Darjeeling Momos here are a must to have! They are the best in taste! Especially the darjeeling red chutney is unique. The MoBurg is also something unique and tastes great! The dining area is very clean and spacious and the staff is very professional. The kitchen is hygienic. It is a place you can visit with friends and family or even alone.,

Portion and size is too less for price paid.. should be atleast 6 piece very costly I paid 150 bucks for each in that you only provide 5 momos? and in one ther were only 4. atleast you should provide minimum 6 pieces if you charge so high. At a normal outlet they provide 8 to 10 pieces for 150 bucks. . Not worth the money Paid,

Taste of momo is not that much good.. though in their outlet is was awesome.. even I didn't get my coke.. and when I call to the delivery boy... it was disconnected..,
,
testy,
,
all r just awsome,
,
The momo was cold &amp; the soft drink was not cold.,
,
less quantity,
,
thank you wow momo. great taste both.,
,
stuffing is not good only one momo stuffed with corn and cheese this is very bad.......,
,
recieved different food than what was ordered.,
,
super,
,
Proper paking. Chicken fried momo good taste ??????????????????????????????????????. Red sauce very ??????????????????????????.,
,
The spicy sauce that Wow Momo used to have was superb. It was more authentic in terms of how the Tibetan and North Eastern States make. The sauce this time had a thicker feel to it and lacked the spiciness and the chilly flakes. Hope you bring back the old sauce.,
,
no issues,
,
it is horrible experience to get such kind of food after spending so much money,
,
Good to eat this food really like it... Especially pan fried was excellent.. I Really Enjoy this food.,
,
instead of schezwan momo they have supplied momos with cheese. which found stale in taste.  very poor quality.  not at all satisfied. this happen first time from woh momo. plz Intimate the outlet,

A different experience. i'm from Goa first time i tried your momos your chilli momo was suberb.. ...,
,
I Visited Wow Momo regularly but today I was very happy to see that I found New Meals  have started and good part is both Veg N Non Veg are of same price. Loved the combo of Chilli Momo Burger and Pepsi and the meals is value for money,
,
raw ingredients,
,
veg momo was stale,
,
moburg packaging was not good,
,
awesome????,
,
Delivery boy was polite &amp; professional..Do give offers more ??,
,
The dish was excellent,
,
Chicken Thukpa  was delicious as usual.,
,
oh it's Love ?,
,
I first try in dine in then want to try our family too..this place has a menu with the most delicious dishes from the world of momos.,
,
"Amazing I ordered in a bunch of things and had a hearty meal. My fellow food lovers and others, please give this place a visit and enjoy the flavors from the north east. Highly recommended! ",
,
burger spicy so please consider next time otherwise very good ??,
,
godd quality,
,
worst combination don't even think about trying it,
,
"burger was very bad they put momo in that,",
,
I received incomplete order. This is very disappointing and highly unprofessional. Even zomato customer service is pathetic and not at all helpful.,
,
how pathetic the experience was,
,
stuffing is not good.,
,
received incorrect order,
,
unexpected,
,
paneer momo was great,
,
Stufffing was good but too much oil... And the worst things I experienced they even not sent any of chutney with Momos.. Thats really very shocking and  disappointing too,
,
taste was not same as it was earlier. Try to improve.,
,
worst is experience ever.. their is no ketchup ..I'm very disappointed,
,
It worst experience ordering food is waste of money,
,
This is the second time the same thing is happening that there are no sauces along with the order!!! Please don’t take orders if you cannot handle rush! How can we eat momos without the sauce??,
,
the order is waste fully wet in rain,
,
ossum. .......... hbbyyyyyccccc?????????????????????,
,
Nothing much,
,
literally oil dripping from momos.,
,
Taste is Good.,
,
??,
,
good taste,
,
Thanks,
,
Very disappointing experience. I am an avid momo lover and constantly order from wow momos but i may need to reconsider.,
,
no complimentary seasoning ! no cheese ! no ketchup,
,
delicious,
,
missed out on half my order,
,
Mo cheese at all in the stuffing. Chicken stuffing was also for the namesake,
,
Tasty momo ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????,
,
they didn't give any tissue paper at all,
,
amazing ??,

I think it was buy one get one,

The spicy sauce that Wow Momo used to have was superb. It was more authentic in terms of how the Tibetan and North Eastern States make. The sauce this time had a thicker feel to it and lacked the spiciness and the chilly flakes. Hope you bring back the old sauce.,

,
There was no sauce with veg momos . It's the important component of the item .how do we take it plain,

There's no doubt that wow momo would be our go-to place for a quick yet a satisfying bite. They have a variety of momos from steam to fried and veg to non veg.  We had ordered for fried corn and cheese momo which was served hot with the dip. It did satisfy our craving. The service was timely and the prices are moderate. They could work on their ambience a little more.  Must visit the place if your a momo lover.,

"don't know what, but something was missing. in my opinion MOMOZING's same dish is better....",

This is a small outlet located besides the gate of seawoods mall. It also has a small seating of around 3-4 tables. You cant go with your gang here. But if your a couple or a group of 4. It's a good place. The pan fred momos are the best you can get. Rest are okay,

"Earlier the quantity of momos used to be three, now it came down to two. Although the taste is same as ever. It used to be my favorite of all, but now I am considering. 3 stars for quantity.",

Wow momo should have provided chutney and mayonnaise with momos order.,
,
"this was second time I was disappointed by wow mom is, last time they cancelled nd gave my order to someone else, this time one item was missing, veg momos were not cooked nd there was a disgusting piece of cardboard in wanna of the steamed momos, I ain't gonna order again from u fellas ",

it was good .But they were supposed to send me extra sauces which they didn't send me quite pissing me off and disapontment.,

Only 2 sets of tissue and cutlery were sent for an order of 3.,

The quality of WoW Momo food has fallen drastically. Would request to give special emphasis in the taste and cooking strategy.,

bitter burnt and no cheese only mayonnaise.,

,
very nice and delicious ???????????????????? ??????,
,
item missing and did not get refund had ordered 2 combos of chicken momo which should give me 4 boxes but only received 1 combo which was 2 boxes ...... extremely disappointed,
,
The amount of red sauce and green chutney was very less compared to my previous orders. And talking about the momo it was heavenly ????,
,
"Sent wrong food items, refuses to admit. Unprofessional behaviour",
,
Very delicious..I really liked it...stuffing was awesome..Thank you wow momo..,
,
"I have ordered combo of mo-burger, chicken fried momo and pepsi can, which worth rs 99. this is totally super offer. quality of momo is really nice. the chicken stuffing in momo of wow momo is much better than any other momo shop. ",
,
Wow MoMo is really WoW!??. Delicious! ?? Awesome! ??,
,
The issue is we have given 2 plates momo orderaa  us me chatne nahe tha,
,
very very small momos....sent veg momo than chicken momo,
,
"it was nice to have such beautiful taste momo , i am very pleased at your services",
,
"sometimes you deliver order without any sauce/ketchup. its not a big issue but imagine yourself received an order like this. embarrassing, right?? my todays order was delivered without any momo sauce and ketch ups",
,
Items were missing from my order. Happened several time. Don't know why they are not something about it. Everytime I have raise complain for it. Please check your staff and try to send correct items as per orders. Terrible service not the first time but fourth time this is happening.,
,
was not fresh. very disappointed. it was unexpected from the brand like wow momo,
,
Don't anything from here especially when the 99wala  offer comes. They give the old stuffing in momos which stings. The 60% of and the offers which are provided by Zomato is a scam..,
,
spilled in the bag its not good in taste also please improve,
,
Green sauce is missing. In the moburg has no chees and so cold. But the chicken momo is hot and outstanding in taste.,
,
in moburg bun was not equal and momo was extremely fried and in Darjeeling chicken pan fried momo is extremely fried...some are taste like a burnt food,
,
One item i.e corn n cheese fried momo was missing in my order and the restaurant didn't take my calls. Pathetic service by Wow Momos Haus Khaz,
,
as expected?? never disappointed. Good service and as always in my case I always got hot food served.,
,
The burger can be made from a patty that covers the bun and not mere 3 momos. Should send mayonnaise as well with the momos.,
,
"momos too oily and bland, burger also tasteless...",
,
"The taste, size and overall quality was significantly lower than other WOW Momo outlets, not expected!",
,
Absolute rubbish in taste. Momos were chewy and got rubber like texture and got no amount of cheese in it. It was also not hot upon arriving.  Wow Momo is fooling their customers .,
,
Very good service by the restaurant. ???? food quality was also very good??. Thank you wow! Momo &amp; zomato for make my day very special. .,
,
i did notrecieved the parcel às your valet was dengerous,
,
I ordered 3 chicken dishes from Wow momo after seeing their offer but the quality of the chicken is foul. It’s smelling very bad. All the dishes have the same foul taste and smell. The dishes are not fresh and the chicken is definitely rotten. . I’d like to complain about the quality of the food being served under the ‘deal of the day’ offer,
,
Loved it. Burger can be better though. Combo &amp; Single momos both are good stuff. Fried &amp; Steamed both. ????,

Momos were dried &amp; hard to eat. . Moburg chicken was very softy as the bun.was.sticking in the fingers,
,
Nice momos. I loved it. After leaving Kolkata this is the first time I'm having momos,
,
Wow momos are always wow. But would just say that tissues were missing and one of the momo was broken but it didn’t hamper its taste. So I was fine with ?? it .,
,
delayed inefficient wrong delivery..no courtesy to call,
,
v good taste. quality quantity very good. packaging,
,
awesome momos..healthy hygienic less oily and super prlce!!!. truly WOW!!,

Veg darjeeling momo is left over taste. I don't like it,

Paneer Momo was bad.. the paneer was stale and smelled/tasted bad,
,
"I was totally unaware of how tasty will be the combination of burger and momos , after i tasted their burgers i was totally in love with them it was really good i tasted all their chicken and veg momo burgers and with totally affordable price I love wow momo ",
,
ordered 2 momos ....the dip quantity was too lesss..plz increase the quantity,
,
The taste was amazing. Cheese was baked properly and the momos were amazing.,
,
I really love the momos I have also recommend this to my friends and colleagues after n numbers of order from you thank you??????,
,
"Usually a good bet when they have deals, they sent just plain fried and steamed chicken momos this time, with 3 red chutney packets. With delays, it an hour to reach and the Pepsi was warm. Not the best experience overall.",
,
Corn &amp; Cheese momo was a bit bland. Apart from that it was okish,
,
thank you . great service from Zomato team . thank you so much,

excellent services by reasturant really awesome enjoyed alot,

"cold drink is normal, not even little cold... what am I supposed to do with this cold drink?",
,
no dip was provided. horrible experience. how am i supposed to eat this.,
,
Fried momos sucks and the taste was useless. Will never go for fried momos again,
,
chutney is very spicy and can be appreciated by AP guys who eat too much spicy,
,
the Momo's was not hot alt all I'm not happy at all,
,
"Yummy, tasty steamed momos but they were broken when I opened the box. Filling everywhere except inside the momos!. You simply cannot enjoy a momo when it’s broken apart like that.",
,
I ordered 20 pieces momos and was delivered 10 pieces. Even the service executive gave me a lollipop of a discount code. shitty restaurant and shitty service from Zomato,
,
"my momo had a hair. you people are not even following basic safety measures , playing with lives of your customers refund the money or else we'll meet in consumers court",
,
had a bitter after taste possible the cabbage used was not washed properly. Even was under cooked. Not Good,
,
"I ordered chicken schezwan momo , the momos I received were smelling more like prawn momo and the taste too was not fresh so i threw them all away. Only the cold drink was fine.",
,
"The terrible place always messes up with their orders. Don't order anything from here and from zomato as they don't do anything about it. For the past hour, I was trying to get my money refund but they didn't do it. Such a bad experience.. Please it's a request for all of you not to order anything from here. They always mess up with the items and deny it. ",
,
"The momos stuffing was tight solid, because mostly the stuffing would be juicy. ",
,
pure disappointment??.. the momo was entirely rotten.,
,
worst experience this is my first and last order from u guys.. worst taste..and I checked ur reviews I have seen all and most of them are negative,
,
over fry hoe gache ...thanda hoe gechilo ...??????,
,
was delivered cold food inspite of the restaurant being near my home,
,
wastage of money,
,
I have older it for dinner  how can I eat that where in cheese the hair is there,
,
"Burnt food and wrong item has sent , mayonnaise instead of cheese dip.",
,
mommos was cold and old. seems like they just packed out from freezer.,
,
it's full of hard roast with out any stuff on 7 pcs out of 10,
,
only plain maida puff fried one no stuffing absolutely waste of.money,
,
"I ordered from Wowo Momo, but delivery boy handed me Wow China",
,
"Despite the fact that cutlery was supposed to be provided, it wasn't there and also the packets of sauce were leaking all around in the plastic. No boxes were properly sealed inside. . But Food was Satisfactory.",
,
order given veg darjeeling fried momo. got veg darjeeling steam momo. . bill attached,
,
momos layer and stuffing both get separate from eachother and mo burger is worst i have ever eated bread was like watery flour sorry wow monos first time i have experienced you worst,
,
"nowadays the momo has a bad stench, they don't feel fresh. please look into this.",
,
The sauce would have been better on the side as a dip. The  momos are drenched in spicy sauce. Its inedible. Usually the sauce is sent on the side so that one has control over the amount they want. The whole meal is just a ball of fire and no taste.,
,
Not at all satisfied with the taste and mayonnaise was not given. Road side momos tastes better than this,
,
The moburgs are just amazing for their price..must definitely try.,
,
amazing taste and good delivery amazing momo loved it,
,
horrible and stale,
,
I had order 1 burger 1 veg momo .. BT I was just received burger not the momo.. Although they you have charged momo price as well. . gud ????,
,
Chicken Darjeeling Pan fried momo - felt overcooked,
,
Gave order for 2 combis but they gave only half the order and shamelessly denied that they made the mistake. Even if you do order don't order from the City Centre 1 outlet.,
,
"Excellent taste , delicious ! ",
,
with full of oil and quality is not upto mark ..I don't like it .,
,
too thin lear of cheese. some places of cheese are burn,
,
"Your momos was very bad, you are providing raw raw products....By eating which people can be harmed, so I will not order it from this service......very bad ",
,
They give only spoiled food and they said my refund will be in 7 days it's been 2 months and still to refund Stop cheating and do your work properly don't cheat people. It's not gonna help you . I got spoiled food and the person who ate it was suffering from a stomach pain.,
,
So much oily not at all crispy no sauces only red chillies flavour,
,
Sauce was not fresh at all... Shame,
,
"Please provide green chutneys with all orders. The cold beverage was packed with the hot food box itself which made the cold drink really worthless in taste as it was hot at first and then warm and lukewarm. It's supposed to be carried in a seperate pouch already provided to the Zomato Valets as per my knowledge. Please improve the service, it's no match to the high amount of service charge that you tax out from customers. The momos were breaking and there was no cutlery despite my mentioning that I wanted the cutlery. Previous day they sent cutlery and green chutney and today there's none of it, both orders within a span of 3 weeks. Food is good I guess, but decide how you want to serve your customer first. ",
,
I ordered two one plus one pkts.That is 4 packets in total.But received only two.,
,
what the hell is this? food completely spill out. and order 2 plates 1+1 got only 1 plate.,
,
I ordered the pan fried Darjeeling momos. They were perfect. Fresh &amp; hot and the perfect amount of spice. I ate it with mayo that I had at my house and it was perfect. I’d suggest the restaurant to start serving these momos with mayo to balance the flavours.,
,
. Cold food. . Bad taste. . Doesn’t look fresh.,
,
"very nice guy, delivered food on time...............",
,
"I loved the paneer momos there and loved the taste, never had momos in life but the planner momos the fried one were amazing but a bit of too much oil ",
,
didn't give chutney with momo,
,
"I did not like the momos. The filling inside tasted very bland and not well prepared and stale. Mostly they are pan fried so taste good initially, but I would not recommend this place. I did not think of them as healthy at all.",

The delivery agent is too good and polite,
,
"The momos were chilled, chutney was not fresh too. I was too busy for claiming a refund. ",

"I have been eating wow momo since 4-5 years and this was the worst experience , can't beleive ",

it was good taste of flavour's..????,

I would have liked it better without the sauce. But it was still pretty good!,
,
taste good...............,

We are happy with the momos but the chutney was a little stale today and smelling.,
,
"I ordered 1 plate cheese corn fried momos and 1 plate paneer steam momos, and paid the amount online. But when order was delivered I received just 1 plate cheese corn fried momos only. I asked the vallet he said he received one package only. And when I tried calling the restaurant they are not picking up. ",

there is a mistake in my order,
,
not worth the price they are charging for this momos. It's too expensive and I can get much better momos with such high price,
,
Good but it was not that much hot,
,
food was cold because of 2 orders given to rider from Zomato MoMos you can't have cold,
,
Food was cold and taste was like prepared long time ago. Cold drinks were also not good. But the thing is that the food should be fresh and little bit hot not cool. I am very disappointed compare to previous order.,

"What's the point of ordering a combo when half the order is delivered wrong. There was no drink given as it should've been according to the combo. Some of the momos were bad  nd had a rotten smell. Plus my order was so much delayed than the given delivery time. That's still manageable, at least the order must be right when I'm paying for this.",
,
Very excellent delivery service ??,
,
excellent,
,
very disappointed because .....there was no chutney with chicken cheese steam momo,
,
"chutney not sent with fried momo.., overall good food...",
,
Good amd tasty,
,
orderd 2 burger and got only 1 and I already mentioned to keep tomato ketchup but there was no ketchup..,

Rich creamy cheese in momos... I was really sceptical at first about trying these out but I'm glad I did. It really tastes amazing! 5/5,
,
thank you??,
,
Garda..??,

This store keeps messing up orders. unfortunately this is the only store that delivers to my place. Have already reduced ordering from wow momo due to their incapability to serve the right order.,

I Just love it..I'm non-vegetarian..but I love veg momo from the WOW MOMO shop,
,
All is okay.,
,
they delivered half of the order,
,
"Horrible taste, food was cold.. I ordered for cheesy veggie moburg which was without cheese. Its was described that veggie moburg is without cheese with less price however cheesy veggie moburg was with cheese and higher price but there was no difference between those. You people are charging Rs.20 extra for cheese and giving nothing. Worst burger ever had.",
,
there has been a double payment. the delivery guy took Rs. 290 in cash as well as had us do paytm. kindly refund the money asap.,

"Some issues with the place and the guys making and packing the momos. My order was a take away for the veg steamed momos which they didn't have in stock, and then provided me with the darjeeling momos. The guy frying the momos doesn't wear his gloves in both the hands. The place is really small hence v less scope for social distancing. Lastly after I took my order. Both the boxes of my momo chutney were stale and spoilt. . It tasted bad. ",

,
Chicken Darjeeling momos are toooooo spicy .. couldn’t eat more than a half and my tummy is paining after eating,

I ordered two packs and I got one pack. this is unacceptable,

green chutney was not given. and excessive calling from the delivery boy,
,
Chicke  tandoori momos are awesome. Good in test n texture. We loved a lot. Everyone should  try. There also have offer on zomato were they give all momos in@99 only.,
,
Product is nicely deliverd. Momos are good in test. They follow instrctions. Communication towards guest is very polite.,
,
delicious,
,
"I have gone to this place twice to eat sizzlers and had to walk out without having one. . The first time, the Chef had an argument with store manager right in front of the customers. He was not willing to cook as he said there is too many orders in queue. I asked the guy at the counter if he is taking my order but he was looking at the store manager and chef having the argument. I decided to leave by saying that I am leaving. None of the staff bothered to apologize or ask us to order something else.. The second time was a week ago. I landed at the restaurant with family to give it a second try. There were other customers having their food inside the restaurant. But when I reached at the order counter, they immediately told me that they have issues and are not taking orders. I had reached a little before 8PM on a Saturday.. While I love Wow!Momo, this particular outlet is horrendous. I hope the management/franchisee holder is reading this and hires adequate and professional staff.",
,
Good Food,
,
No green chatni is there is the package. Atleast this time red chatni is there. last time both green and red chatni was missing. This is very disappointing!,
,
there order included a 250vml thumps up but I did not received it,
,
"The red chatni you gave was rotten and the coating of the momos was pathetic kept falling, you have a good name dont cheat people under that ! ",
,
"food wasn't packed properly, inside fillings were also less, taste was very basic like boiled vegetables. ",
,
"Perfect order and perfect Delivery. The quantity is awesome. Taste, texture and warmth of the momos and moburgs maintained even after the delivery. Awesome job guys keep it up",
,
momos Chutney should also be provided as complementary.,
,
not hot and bad taste...,

The food tastes delicious. . But momos are better than Moburg.,

Combo comes with added pepsi which is a holy grail for every food combo ????",
,
packaging was not good.. the soup overflowed.. really bad experience,

today at about 7.52 P.M I ordered for Steam momo at the counter but the cashier lady told me there is no steam momo. so I have to order fried momo..this is a problem or created problem I don't know..no every one like fried or pan fried.. whatever while receiving my order I asked for spoon or fork the cashier lady tried to teach me that spoon and fork does't go with momo..well @Wow! Momo so tell me whether she is arrogant or its your failure to train her properly.. then you provide chop stick if spoon or fork doesn't go with momo? further more when I challanged her that in other outlet it is given and I am not first time in wow momo I will shoot a video of her misbehaviour another staff tried to do the damage control by giving me a fork..then she goes on shouting that I have come here to create a scene...bla bla bla.... Dear Wow! Momo I ask you is this kind of arrogant behavior is expected from a cashier? is this your training? or its just that you don't care...non availability of steam momo augratin can be understandable but this kind of misbehaviour is not at all expected..I have paid what you have charged and I have asked for a fork to eat which she refused me to give...so who is to be blamed?  fork? chopstick? or momo? lolzzz..,
,
Overall The Taste was So Good And the food was so hot also .. but packaging spills should be monitored and the oil quantity should be seen coz it's too oily.,

"Good quality but the problem is organization skills of the staff here in Advant outlet. Whenever they run any offer like ""everything in Rs99"" kind of, I think, they can't handle the orders properly and sent wrong orders to you. I have ordered Chicken steam cheese momo and they sent me fried momo and that also it happened with me 3 times. You can ignore the mistakes but not same mistakes everytime. And the strange part is that they always do this mistake with this single item ""chicken cheese steam momo"". I think, staff also love this momos and they dont want to give it to their customers and having them for themselves only. Lol ??",

I think he was in the intention of not handing over the food to me.He kept his phone busy &amp; even said lies that i did not pick up the phone. After I sent a recorded instruction, he picked up my phone. Finally when he came he started a brawl with me &amp; was harsh in his words. He even said that the order does not have name, well that""s a total lie. Because in the zomato bill it had my name &amp; address. So I lost my appetite after this horrified incident. ",

"??Just one word for their food preparations would be WOW! As the name goes, the quality of the food is just amazing, I really loved it.. . ??First of all I visited here to have their well-known sizzlers, but unfortunately it wasn't available on that time, and I was really disappointed...Nevermind, but I still had some amazing stuff which made me happy. . The dishes that I tried were-. Butter Chicken Momo's. Butter Paneer Momo's. Chicken Augratin (small). . ??All the dishes were fantastic. The butter chicken and paneer momo was really good which was tossed in butter-masala gravy and had a nice creamy texture.. The Chicken augratin was really nice, slightly little more towards sweeter side. It consisted of 3 chicken momo's along with it which were tasty, soft and juicy.. . ??Do visit Wow! Momo to have some 'wow' experience with your friends and family.. . ??Follow 'theqfcompany'on Instagram for more such updates..!!!. . Thank you..!!!. #HappyEating",

They are charging for this shit and taking taxes for shitty food and there was a momo missing from my cheese momo,
,
Incomplete order has been delivered. Veg Moburg has not delivered.,
,
It was hard to believe that momos could be screwed up so bad till I had some from wow momos. Veg momos appeared to be filled with leftover vegetables collected from restaurants in their vicinity. Corn and cheese momos were filled with horrible quality cheese/Mayo.,
,
there was a cold drink added in the Darjeeling momo and moburg combo photo. but didn't recrive any cold drink.,
,
"Rated 1 star for the fact that i ordered for Chicken &amp; Cheese Pan Fried without schezwan sauce as  me &amp; my kidcan't eat spicy. . zomato then took a request for getting the order replaced but then again the placed order came same.. spicy stuff.. . how can a mistake be repeated twice in span of 20 mins... would definitely want wow momo to place more attention on this minute details.. . overall generally whenever I ordered wow momo products, taste never let me down",

Just to point what they did right and to make things easy for first time WOW Momo goers , do try their Pan Fried Momo's range they are delicious . I only cut 1 star coz there was no seating arrangement and slight hygiene issue where I was standing and eating",

I item seemed soak and melted and dosnt taste good,
,
The colour of the food is different from what i ordered. I have ordered two of the same things and they both look different.,
,
The filling for the momo was sour/stale and is totally unedible. Had to throw it away,

The momos werr not properly cooked. The maida in the binding was not cooked properly. The food was not in edible state. It was undercooked,
,
I didn?t get the mayo dip,

Only 1 plate has come.. Though we have ordered 2,
,
It was a combo which includes a Pepsi bottle the delivery has no Pepsi bottle,

The food was extremely cold and burnt,

Dough is completely undercooked,

Due to the bad packaging the food was spoiled out,

All the filling was out tasteless,

The preparation is very dry and bland in taste. The noodes portion is not properly cooked and momos have no sauce them in. The base should be a Schezwan based sauce but it's very very dry irrespective of calling and telling the restaurant the same,

i ordered to one box of pan tossed schewan spicy sauce momos and another box of tomato garlic sauce momos but they delivered two boxes of . Spicy sauce momos. . When I took this issue to Zomato they just ask me to write a review instead of Give giving a proper solution. . I guess Zomato has started doing favours for the restaurant instead of giving a proper solution to its customers,
,
a foil part came within momo,
,
I would definitely not recommend their momo's. High priced and you get only 5 momos. Not worth the price.,
,
the chutney is all over the food.,
,
i enjoyed the food,
,
my food is cold,
,
"wow momo is stuffing soya chunks in chicken momos, and the prices are so high! quality is deteriorating day by day",

"I had ordered veg baked momo augratin, because back in the time, I had once tasted the same from wow momo and loved it, but that is, I think a past story, coz, today what I received from the restaurant was not momo augratin, rather it was a combination of noodles with momo in Schezwan sauce baked with a layer of stale cheese on top.. Really disappointed, Augratin is supposed to be cheesy and creamy but this one was spicy to the hell, and even the momos were not cooked properly, the outer covering was thick and felt raw.. And I don't know which special recipe this restaurant follows, that they bake augratin in schezwan sauce.. Please don't ever order baked momo augratin from this place, your money will be wasted, like it happened with me.. Infact I am never going to order anything from this out of the world restaurant that follows it's own outer world recipes and fools customers, not only deceives them of their money but also wastes and disrupts their life.. I would suggest no one to order from here, as the quality is not what used to be once.",

"I had ordered veg baked momo augratin, because back in the time, I had once tasted the same from wow momo and loved it, but that is, I think a past story, coz, today what I received from the restaurant was not momo augratin, rather it was a combination of noodles with momo in Schezwan sauce baked with a layer of stale cheese on top.. Really disappointed, Augratin is supposed to be cheesy and creamy but this one was spicy to the hell, and even the momos were not cooked properly, the outer covering was thick and felt raw.. And I don't know which special recipe this restaurant follows, that they bake augratin in schezwan sauce.. Please don't ever order baked momo augratin from this place, your money will be wasted, like it happened with me.. Infact I am never going to order anything from this out of the world restaurant that follows it's own outer world recipes and fools customers, not only deceives them of their money but also wastes and disrupts their life.. I would suggest no one to order from here, as the quality is not what used to be once.",

When I took this issue to Zomato they just ask me to write a review instead of Give giving a proper solution. . I guess Zomato has started doing favours for the restaurant instead of giving a proper solution to its customers,

"How is this chain in business?! The taste isn't anything special and considering the price, it is just criminal. Also the cutting of the corners here is just baffling. You look at the cup for dip and think ""Oo there is plenty"" but then you dip something in it and realise that it is not as deep as they make it to look like. It's just a poot of sauce in there. Nowhere near enough. The moburg was so dry that the govt now has to divert an artificial canal towards my mouth. Bun used in it was an absolute tragedy. . . I gave it 2 stars because I purchased it on an offer. If I had got this on the actual listed price then I would have filed a case for robbery. ",

Do not provide items what's shown in the menu when you're going for a dine in they say straight away that it's not available where as if you order from swiggy or zomato the same items are available in a very cost than dine in. NOT WORTHY OF PRICE and Quantity also is LESS. They are a BIG CHEAT!!!!!,

who sends green chutney with momos. don't u have shezwan sauce and mayo?,

"i think they were rushed into delivery, should have spent another 5 minutes in cooking it better. tasted slightly raw. ",

Inedible. Chicken was stale and the momo dough was hard and not at all fresh. And the sauces that they were fried in were also not fresh and unnecessarily spicy. Most awful momos I've ever eaten. Please avoid ordering from here.,

momos were cold. We're not steamed just before packing.,

"one of the best momo's I have had. I ordered  pan-fried momos and it tastes so good.. The price is a little bit high but is value for the money.. You will not feel content by just having one serving, You will definitely ask for more.. Keep up the good work Wow Momo Team !. . . ",

Ordered chilli momos and they were truly wow.. Best momos I ever had. A must try for every momo lover,

Schezwan sauce was already added on it. and looked kind of messed up. it would be better if you could give sauce seperate and  allow us to pour it on.,
,
I had ordered Veg Momos 2 plates which included 10 pieces. I got just 1 plate with 5 pieces of Momos instead. After sending the pictures and waiting for over 15minutes I still got no help from the customer service manager Niel who failed to do his duty. extremely disappointed with the restaurant and Zomato for their inefficiency,

too expensive for momos. the chatni was very very spicy,
,
"Poor packing no fizz, rotten momo sauce waste of money think before order",
,
I'm order fried momo but wow !momo deliver me cold steem momo its to bad experience ....,

Red sauce they sent is spoiled and looks like they have reheated old momos as I ordered it at the time of closing.only moberg was little bit upto the mark .,
,
delivery was more than one hour late.. restaurant didn't picked up the call..food came was cold..,
,
"Corn and cheese fried was below average . I ordered garlic sauce, was given schezwan. Bad show from zomato",

Momo size and stuffing is good it's just that there chatni is too spicy. Over all good quality momos.,
,
"No Veg/non veg marking on the boxes, no bill with delivery, only a single chutney.. . Can't expect this from my beloved food brand.. Relly disappointed. ",
,
the taste was so bad I cant expect from wow momo ??,

"Bought it in offer of 99/- for all. Didn't like the momos the stuffing was not at all cooked well, in the corn fried one the corns felt undercooked.. Overall overpriced it is, may be the ambience would be better never gone there.",

momos were horrible....it was too stinky and foul smell..the restaurant owner told me he will exchange but did not send the fresh momoms....they told all Schezwan momos are over...worst food and restaurant... please don't buy,
,
"The momos weren't fresh, especially the chicken cheese momos. It was soggy and half cooked. Cheese wasn't fresh. The steamed momos were half cooked too. Was looking forward to a good snack time, unfortunately it was a disaster. Hopefully, you will look into the same. ",
,
please serve good and properly cook food....I'm very disappointed with food.....weird,
,
food quality ??,
,
received both boxes veg momos only. no chicken momo. also the chutney/sauce was not given.,
,
what happened to the chocolate momo it seems it haven't got love from the chef,
,
Packing is poor. Need to cook momos more especially the steam momos,
,
good taste must try for momo lovers.. chicken pan fried momo,
,
I specifically asked for no Chili’s and pepper and they made it the spiciest Momos ever. Pls read the instructions,
,
I have paid 142rs &amp; got the bill of 116rs....please clarify,
,
The veg momos was too smelly it’s was not at all good. And chicken momos were also ok types,
,
not fresh..tasted like stored food..corns were tight not soft,
,
why did you mix the sauces...it spoiled the entire taste of the momos. you should send green and red sauce separately.,

Chiken not fress,

"poor quality service. charging  high prize but not providing its value in terms of quantity and quality .I had ordered corn n cheese momos ...there was very less quantity of cheese only corn stuffed in momos  . they provide only green chutney  , red chutney  was not provided by them   .packaging   of chutney boxes  was worst as it looks like they give us used chutneys. wastage of money .",
,
Good Service and Nice tease of the momos...............................................................,
,
Extremely disappointed for the second time!,
,
worst taste ever in my like time and able to see only one or two chicken pieces............if there is a zero rating or lesser that that I would have been rated it......waste of money,
,
It is so so tasty and your delivery boy Mr.Nirjan is also a good person.,
,
don't call again again...,
,
It was really yummy..but was a bit spicy..overall good??,
,
"the service was good, delivered fresh and with safety. Looking forward to placing more orders. satisfied ",
,
I have called restaurant also but they said we are getting raw momos from Mumbai so we don't know anything. Bad experience.,
,
not up to mark.  !! but better than Alambagh joint,
,
Disappointed by the packing for both the orders and very little sauce was provided for veg momos. Also one of them was broken.,
,
None,

"Momos are extremely tasty, but the Temperatures are not measured. . Hope #WowCare will take care of this",
,

,
"I ordered (1)Darjeeling Pan Fried Schezwan Momos &amp; (2) Regular Chilly Paneer..  . (1) The momos were extremely spicy,someone who loves too much spice would love it.. It gave a burning sensation inside.. Also the stuffing was not upto the mark and tasted like they were boiled and kept a day before frying them.. . (2) Chilly Paneer too was very spicy.??. And the paneer was very stretchy in texture.. . Guyz you really can do better.Dn’t spoil the trust and name.",
,
Not at all concerned about the customers satisfaction only looking forward to make money no wrapping no quality,
,
"Steam momo was smelling, not at all fresh &amp; pan fried was cold by the time received the food. Not at all acceptable. . . Horrible experience.",

,
"Burger was not up to the mark, No cheese at all",
,
I didn't get enough chutney for  even 1 person with my momos,
,
wallet refused to deliver at 5th floor as lift was not working,
,
the restaurant took really late for delivering my parcel,
,
it was so tempting that i forgot to take pictures and ate it right away.. delicious..,
,
Waoooo,
,
Butter masala momos were heavenly and chilli momos were spicy and amazing..Perfect taste and had great experience,
,
good,
,
the Burger bun was burnt,
,
All momos are completely cold... so not enjoyable to eat...,
,
It was soggy and very saucy… too much sauce  on momos and they became very limp like khichdi,
,
very very bad taste.. there is no taste at all.. . you people charge 200 for 1 pack. atleast it should to some good taste.. I had same Schewzan Pan Fried Chicken in other outlets. those were really good.. but this is waste of money and tastes nothing.. . really disappointed,
,
It was a nice experience from WoW Momo &amp; never disappointed the expectations. Had called them up &amp; had mentioned specifically to provide everything hot &amp; fresh. It was followed &amp; obliged.. . Only Zomato created a blunder by giving their Delivery executive a wrong route to deliver first to a far off location then my location which additional 20 mins to deliver the package at my Address which is 500 mtrs from the Restaurant ??,
,
worst packaging i have received,
,
i ordered chicken steam momos and veg chilli momos. i did not like the taste at all... chicken momos were totally bland and chilli momos veggies were burnt and tasted bad. won't recommend!,
,
it's a little pricey. But the taste is unmatched.,
,
momo had a great texure and it was really delicious . I wanna eat again. But about the moburg it was average,
,
chatney quantity was very small. Burger doesn't contain proper sauce and mayo.,
,
its getting cold,
,
Just too spicy. Couldn't enjoy the original taste.,
,
"First I would like to tell that I ordered it from zomato, but received it with the outer seal by swiggy. dont know why?. . Second thing I often order the same combo maybe by using from different account found very good taste and quality each and every time.but unfortunately not today. The food I have received it was not good in taste. I found some different texture in dough, it was taste like street momo, not wow momo standard. and one more thing it was not atall sealed from inside.. The zomato boy was nice.",
,
the entire chicken inside was raw,
,
it should atleazt be 6 PC per plate for the rate charged,
,
"Added extra mayonnaise which is paid, But didn't added part of delivery..",
,
No sauce provided with the momos,
,
the valet ask a tip,
,
Portion size too less!For the price there should be at least 10 momos and there should be a white dip option too.,
,
Food not bouling,
,
"While my experience with this joint is a hit and miss, but I do give them props for the innovations that they have done with one of the most popular street food in the country.. . I've had multiple orders from here thanks to mostly good offers that we see. I've tried following items:-. . 1. Moburg -&gt; I've tried Chicken moburg, an innovative and quite tasty item. 5/5.. 2. Fried Momos -&gt; Everyone likes a fried momos. :) 4/5. 3. Pan fried Momos -&gt; Schezwan flavour which is sweet and sour flavour. A good alteration. 4/5. 4. Veg cheese Momos -&gt; A miss for me. Bland, too much garlic and too much cheese making it a little mealy. 2/5. . Overall, the joint is serving great variations of classic street food which is VFM with given offers. Cheers!",
,
awesome taste love it,
,
wow momo rocks! best momos,
,
I visited first time in Wow Momo Indra Nagar I ordered for pan fry and Hakka Noodles Large taste was amazing. Loved it Keep it up willl share it the feedback to my friends and willl surely come again. . . Thank You Wow Momo Keep it up ??????,
,
good and tasty food,
,
"I have been ordering their types of Momo! What I didn't like is their pricing it's over rated. Additionally they send the sauce as an accompaniment which taste differ from time to time also not sure,if corrainder sauce is an right accompaniment with momo! Price is higher than normal! Honestly perfect example of monopoly fooling arround people for 5 piece momo @129 while u can get it arround 50 rupees outside.. ????",
,
great,
,
good,
,
missing items.,
,
Worst taste,
,
Momos were quite soggy. Taste was averages. Quite over steamed in flavour.,
,
Wasn't hot when delivered,
,
"6 plate momos ordered. Only 4 packets of sauce packed, out of which 3 zip locks were not sealed causing everything to spill. Also boxes were not packed properly, hence more spillage. Good in taste but very poor packing. ",
,
Chutney adds spice to the momos. What’s the use when less and unspicy chutney is served? We miss the flavour. . Overall - 2.75/5. Momos - 4/5. Chutney - 1/5. Quantity - 2/5,
,
very very nice taste I like it ????,
,
Truly it's WoW.,
,
it was just like smacking,
,
Rating based only on food... . An urge to have chinese food made me look in zomato and that is when i found Wow China on Wow Momo.. A Delivery only outlet located in the pallavaram area.. This is my fist try of this outlet for chinese food though i have tried momos many times..so i went in blind... . Ordered in a Chicken Fried rice in hot garlic sauce(rs190) and honey chili chicken(rs139).. Perfectly packed in eco friendly packaging and delivered in a quick time... . The Chicken Fried Rice was decent in quantity but the chicken was very less IMO.. The taste however was good but the garlic sauce effect was very less.. Almost negligible.. The Startup Honey Chili Chicken was a new try.. The taste of honey along with slight chili hint was good but the chicken was a tad bit hard to bite into due to the dryness... . Overall good in taste but the less amount of chicken in fried rice and dry meat in the honey chilli chicken spoiled the experience for sure... . Total bill of 330rs was a good when considering the quantity and taste.. but the quality could have been better...,
,
bad odour coming from momos not edible,
,
for burger full rating but for momos it will be 3.,
,
it was way too spicy,
,
"what non sense is this. I am a regular customer of WOW MOMO and i was in an emergency, i need to have food. i am outside, far from my home and i wrote in the instruction to provide me spoon to have momo cause i was outside and cant have momo with my bare hands thats y. i wrote the instruction. But inspite of several requests WOW MOMO dont send spoon. Due to this worst service i and my family and my colleagues will not order Momos from WOW MOMO.",
,
"seemed cooked much time before the order placement and too spicy to eat, had to throw. ",
,
ordered extra mayo.. got only regular red chilli sauce.. where's the mayonesse?,
,
The stuffing had mud particles and was the same in all the momos.. very disappointing..,
,
The food reached just in time - piping hot and in perfect packaging!,
,
Veg and non veg labels were wrong,
,
The momos were not steamed properly.,
,
"delivery was good , on point , but the food was not even worth it...",
,
"food Quality is little bit compromised.I think, may be because of price constraints. otherwise 9 times I get quality food out of 10 orders",
,
"it's costly, very costly",
,
good no issues like the spicy chtney my wife favourite but received broken pieces so plz take car next time.,

,
Now I have ordered panir fried  momo. This momo  was very bad in taste and smells .. I didn't expect that..????,

I really don't like uncooked veggies on momo,
,
The momo was over cooked and was broken. Never excited this,
,
I ordered Darjeeling Steam Momosn being a regular of Wow Momo since Miftaur and Sagar had their first store at Saltlake Sector V RDB Boulevard back in 2010. Honestly the momo was stinking there was typical stench quality of the food has attorciously degarded!!,

"ordered 2 fried momos and got only 1, pathetic service, neither got refund nor any compensation.",

"quantity was missing , I got only 10 momos instead of 20 momos , so 2 packs of 5 each were missing , bag was not fully sealed , valet did not hand the order in my hand , and customer service could not help so I feel like I got robbed",

,
One insect was inside the mono.. pathetic hygiene you people are following..,

You forgot my order,

I tried this veg pan fried schezwan momos for the first time and I felt like love at first bite only. Food was wow but it would be gr8 if you serve 1 or 2 pc more with that price along w that I will always be eager to get such discounts?? we foddie will be very thankful to you ?,
,
I’m vegetarian and the pan fried Momo was smelling of non veg….. have heard this from friends too wo stay near behala,
,
why was there no chutney? am I supposed to be eating this dry?,
,
the momo served was not hot,
,
They forgot to send momos sauce without Which it is nothing. This is the basic thing and it is not expected from such brands,
,
please refund me on momos. this service is not acceptable. you are a brand and you serve like this ????,
,
For 2 plates of momo they gave only small amount of chilli sauce. Could not enjoy it. Can give better service.,
,
the quantity of momos according to the price is really less also the momos are too spicy,
,
Very bad ?? I ordered veggies fried rice with chilli paneer but received veggie fried rice with veggies cutlet … ?????? very disappointed . Even the soup was salty . Momos was ok,

Who puts RAW chopped garlic and raw green chilies on top of CHILLI MOMOS. The most pathetically made momos I have ever had. I am a regular customer of wow momos but last 2 deliveries were disgusting. It was dam spicy.. a human can’t eat it. Please try and make momos worth eating.,

"Momos are okay-ish. I expected better standards and taste. Good to try once though. Their Moburgs are good. Price seemed costly, and their zomato rates are exorbitant. Everything is like 250+ bucks for a plate of momos. ",

Would like to request to make the smoke from cooking area to exaust well. It can cause irritation to the eyes over there.",

"So I ordered the pan fried momos and when I got them they were all over the place so much so that as soon as I got the box out they fell right out. When I asked for help, your very irresponsible staff did nothing about it. I sent pictures to them as well. Once I was transferred to another person and he did not even listen. I just marked the issue as resolved. Your employees need to do their job. I am never ordering from Zomato again. I will manipulate people around me also to do the same because people have had bad experiences too on more the 2 occasions. . If you want to keep and option that gives help insure that your employees do so.",

Receiver veg momos 2 plate instead of 1 plate of veg and 1 of darjeeling momo,

There is no sauce in packet,

One pepsi can missing,

I opted for panfried momos in Schezwan sauce. Instead I just received steamed momos.,
,
The entire order is spoilt I received the items after 2 hours the moburg seems to be pathetic and soggy the the fried momo inside the burger needs to be crispy but it's all soggy and food and money I invested in this Is totally of waste now,
,
Ordered for schezwan but received chicken chilly,
,
Momos are brunt more and not even good to eat<br/>Test terrible in brunt,

I'd say that the street momos taste much better than the momos at Wow! Momos. You guys really need to work on the taste of your food. I'm never going to try it again, and surely it felt like very unhygienic.. . I wouldn't recommend anyone ordering from here. You'd be better eating momos from street side vendors.",

I'm never going to try it again, and surely it felt like very unhygienic.. . I wouldn't recommend anyone ordering from here. You'd be better eating momos from street side vendors.",

you can't miss momos without mayonnaise... especially when you are consuming it with very spicy sauce.. you have to tone down the heat as well... shouldn't make mayonnaise separately..rather it should be included in the original package...other than that...it's delicious!,

The fried momos were better than the steamed ones. The Moburgs were pretty good too. But I only bought them because Wow! Momo was Deal of the Day and everything was available for Rs. 99.. . This was a good deal.,

It was very bad. The momo was smelling so bad and the oil was not fresh. Zomato must pay attention to this. Highly ridiculous. Will never order from here. We ordered to use our money to satisfy hunger but instead the food had to be thrown out in the dustbin. At least learn to value your customers.,
,
You should send the less spicy chutney more. The spicy one is very very hot,
,
there was small pebble in the chicken momos which was disappointing.,

The taste I had before isn’t in today’s Momos. Looks like they were not fresh and just steamed some old frozen momos..,

The momos were hot and fresh but the sauce was very bad. It was making the momo taste worse so had to eat without it.,

worst momo ever yuck ?? never ever will suggest to anyone ...,
,
Cheesy chicken moburg is not up to the mark. It is dry and not cheesy,
,
noodles should be more spicy and more gravy,
,
package was not good .. they need to provide better packaging,
,
This is the worst momo i have ever tried ?? it do not have anything other then chilly . While i was eating it i felt like  i was eating raw Spice ?? I know its a pan fried With Schezwan sause but still there should be some other taste rather then spicyy ?? i wasn't able to feel the cheese and corn inside. its a complete waste after eating this i have ate Honey just because it was super super super spicyy (i am that kind a person who prefer spicy in everything but it should have some other tastes too ) .  if any buyer see this i have a great suggestion for u dont buy from Baguiati Outlet its a complete waste try the outlet of Kestopur or some other like CC2 they are 1000 time better then Baguiati's Outlet .  It was a complete waste of money ??.,

"Pepsi in the order, delived 7'up, and missing Momo chatni, . torn packet from bottom, sealed from top..",
,
rotten smell is coming .. please serve the good ones..if not freshly made atleast...not the bad ones,
,
momos were good. chutney could have better.,
,
your delivery boy was good,
,
its too oily.,
,
momo smelled sort of bad and was too dry .  mobirg was dry too,
,
ok,
,
best test,
,
"Taste was good, quality was good, quantity was enoug",
,
I didn't get the complete order. they missed out chicken moburg and chicken cheese momo.  worst response from both Zomato and wow momo.  even with proof they are refusing it,
,
"The momos were half cooked, the dough was raw and tasted bad. Also, we didn't receive the red sauce with steam momos. Very bad experience ! ",
,
The momo coverings had broken. Pl take this feedback and improve. I have been ordering many times and these taste is good but the outer cover can be improved.,
,
freid darjeeling chicken momos and moburg chicken burger... so yummy... love the taste.. ??,
,
burger was too good...the sauce with momos was a bit different tasting a bit sour but all together it was tasting good??,
,
Found hair in the food,
,
no kind of dips are provided. not even any tissues. taste was okay... but please keep these things in mind,
,
nothing just perfect,
,
superb ??,
,
"Very bad experience. The momos were dry, tasted stale. They did not even send the momo sauce. Really? Who does that?",
,
Sauce not provided for even one momo.,
,
packaging is verry poor because when they keep the hot momo in the packet and the vapour doesn't come out and make the momo verry bad .,
,
quantity was very less only 4 momos in Rs. 386 is very costly. They should mention the quantity of momos in menu.,
,
it's very dry... otherwise tasted good?,
,
"Pan fried momo is pathetic, it tasted like a garlic curry with soft momos, really disappointed with Wow Momo",
,
the food delivered was wrong.,
,
You did not add thin soup? . Chatni is very tikha.,
,
very less sauce in Schezwan. only one drop of green chutney in moburg.,
,
"delivered non veg momos instead of veg momoms and dint respond for any calls, even Zomato didn't do anything about it",
,
Taste was not upto the mark:-)  Its expensive when compare to other momo’s,
,
missing items.,
,
the momos were over fried,
,
Momo is not good it like a 1 damage peace,
,
recieved torn momos and the pan fried momos were so spicy that it was inedible. totally disappointed,
,
all momo peice was tear,
,
The steamed momos delivered were stale and cold.,
,
Improve the taste.,
,
pathetic momo i ate in my life. absolutely no sense of responsibility. The chicken was stinking af! i had to gulp it with water n could not throw it coz of course i was hungry,
,
rider was soo good...,
,
uncooked momos,
,
cheese is little bit,
,
No thanks,
,
"several times ordered , so always liked it",
,
As usual tasty and delicious. delivery was also in time.,
,
"momo was very oily and taste disgusting, burger was good.",
,
they took money and gave a a cheap burger! this is a fraud,
,
This is the second time Wow Momo didn't send sauce. Green Sause was missing completely and less number of red sauce. If I'm ordering 9 plates of momo I should be getting atleast 9 sause packets.,
,
The food was undercooked and felt stale while eating,
,
The momos were doughy and raw. i had to steam the momos in my steamer and still the amount of chicken was very less.,
,
"Yesterday we ordered chicken cheese pan fried momo,it was very yummy. Tomato garlic sauce was perfect( non spicy). Coming to the moburg it was good too but steam Darjeeling momo was bad, no proper taste, not sure how much fresh it was and one more thing green chutney was missing from package.",
,
very good,
,
it's not hot.. and worst service I ever got. it's take almost 1 hours to deliver.,
,
The quality has dropped drastically! Nothing was fresh. I will definitely not order from this place anymore. Frozen momos from the market taste more fresh. Very disappointed.,
,
love you santo,
,
both momos are darjeeling ones. corn and cheese ones didn't come. horrible experience!!!,
,
Chicken pan fried momo was too spicy. The moburg was fantastic,
,
Pathetic food quality and pathetic service… Disgusting  is the word for this restaurant!!!!. Would not suggest anyone to order from here !!.,
,
taste very good we liked it??,
,
it was written 5 pieces of momos to be served but I got just 4 and I also informed but no resolution,
,
Momos were good but there was no chutney (sauce) with the same .,
,
spicy delicious,
,
"must try chicken Darjeeling momos it's beyond the world,I fell in love with this momo",
,
"The otherwise delicious meal was completely spoiled by the extremely bad smelling thukpa, of which my entire room still whiffs off. There is no chance that it was mistaken for good soup, due to the over-the-top rotten smell. One would expect an established food chain to be more vigilant and conscientious towards serving bad food.",
,
bura smell,
,
Taste is not all good very bad experience with WOW moms for the first time,
,
Ordered for chilli momos and they were very different and amazing..Packaging was on point and food was served fresh,
,
A complete value for money place...Have always loved their momos..The new launch chilli momos that I tried this time were superb,
,
no cutlery is given,
,
It was too spicy no person could handle that much of chilli,
,
you can add some sallet and extra sauce. packing was nice,
,
bad,
,
very very good and quality of food. noce packed and enough side sauce. But it would great if you provide a hot soup with this.,
,
next time don't forget to deliver small box of spicy chutney,
,
good food,
,
Nil,
,
All are good but fried momos have lots of oil and . . Burger are ok ok,
,
no mayo and very little size,
,
best taste till date,
,
too little portion,
,
Both Chicken Pan Fried Momo and Chicken Darjeeling pan fried momos tastes are same.,
,
Delivery staff was good,
,
taste of momos like previous day cooked one..bad smell was coming from box too,
,
The momos were not fresh.It was stale. so the taste was little bit sour.,
,
Incorrect food items!,
,
very good,
,
without Mayo thoda bhi test nai tha Scezwan koi theli me deta hai chote box me dena chahiye pura sos chipak gaya tha kaise khayege,
,
chutni quality was very poor..wasn't fresh at all..,
,
we gave  you  4 ratting cause we asked for some green chutney but it was not there,
,
pepsi was not sent.disgusting service.callous,
,
I told them to give sauce separately the momos turned soggy and to spicy to eat,
,
"Too much bad quality of food.please don't order this momo. And Sause is very bad , it's  just like chilli paste. Even a streetfood momo is 10000 times better than this branded Wow Momo. ",
,
should be more hot,
,
Please add more greens and vegetables,
,
Received hair in the food very bad and disappointed and didn’t even get refund or replacement,
,
Too much charging for a substanderd food.  Disgusting that they don't serve water.  Space is limited for even 2 person per table.. .,
,
I have not visited this place but have ordered for delivery in my work place multiple times. This way I got the opportunity to try out few of their variants.. || Fried chicken momo|| I love their fried variant. It is crispy outside but juicy inside. It yummy go for it. Rating 5/5.. || Veg fried momo|| I never though veg momo can taste that good. Ordered once and it was really worth ordering. Rating 4.5/5.. || Chicken steamed Darjeeling momo|| all time favourite. It soothes your soul. Rating 5/5.. || Pan fried chicken momo in tomato sauce|| the less spicy version of the pan fried momo. It is perfect for my taste bud. I love it. Rating 5/5.. || Pan fried chicken momo in Schezwan sauce|| it is a bit spicy for me. But good for people who like their food spicy. Rating 4/5.. || Chicken moburg|| I like the moburg a lot. It's a burger with two fried chicken momo inside a bun with a green and red sauce along with mayonnaise. It's tasty. Rating 5/5.,
,
Tried panfried chicken cheese momos and kala khatta..They were both very good..Had a great time with my family,
,
packaging was not done properly,
,
momo's were super soft and just with the right thikness of outer cover. but plz kindly send mayo with the momo's as I'm not a fan of momo chutney. . packaging was good. . overall a good experience. will definitely order again. .,
,
good,
,
This newly opened place at kharabi serves some amazing momos..Have been there few times and loved the momos,
,
took 1hr to deliver n no info was given,
,
the momos were not tasty and packing was damaged due to rain and all in all was not happy with wow momos.. I have tried earlier but this time it was not upto mark,
,
it was soggy...cold and sauce was somewhat tasted stale...not at all how it used to be...,
,
I have gone this outlet with my friends many times before but however I forgot to take a pic of the foods... Yesterday I ordered some from there &amp; I click the pic of the foods.. These are so yummy &amp; delicious I just fall in love with this place &amp; the foods.. I wanna go there again... &amp; grab the foods ?????.      Also the decorations are so good as well as the ambiance is very cute... Everyone should go there ???,
,
please refund my money,
,
give pudina sauce in stead of Chilli sauce which tastes rubish.,
,
they didn't send me the moburg,
,
Had ordered Chicken Moburg and Chicken pan fried momos.. Moburg: It was a pack of 2 burgers with 2 momos in each burger with red and green chutney. Overall it was nice and tummy filling.. Pan fried Momos: It was a pack with 5 momos along with red and green chutney.,
,
Nice food and worth the calories and wait. The  green and the red chutney on the moburg are adding to the taste. However the fried momo aren't that satisfactory.,
,
momo street walo se banana sikho,
,
Nice test and good service..I'm loving it momo ....????????????????????????????????????????????????????,
,
"No dip . Even the taster is sour, not a fresh one",
,
nice en,
,
Packing was not good. Sauces leaked out of box. Sauce packets or container is suggested.,
,
Wow Momo often misses on sending the condiments along with their momos. This time the green as well as red chutney or sauce with the momo was absent. Absolutely shitty service.,
,
chicken turmeric add means good,
,
delivery person is very nice,
,
nice,
,
Waste of money. Never ever I thought that Wow Momos will deliver stale &amp; awful smelling food. Regret that I ordered from here.,
,
I have received burnt momo z not fried ones,
,
The cheese felt really burnt and overcooked.,
,
Felt soggy as if momos were not cooked properly or evenly. For the last 2-3 times also had similar experience.,
,
the valet was excellent,
,
we didn't received the order as whole order was spoiled,
,
aloo lelo,
,
good service,
,
I don't expect this kind of food today. momo was making long time ago. it's cold. cold drinks is also hot.. it seems like they delivery already packed food which was prepared long time ago. I didn't expect from u. I always ordered from u and it was good. but not today. hopeless??,
,

,
"2 bad experiences from this wow momo:. first time when I ordered pan fried corn &amp; cheese momo they gave pan fried paneer momo...that time I didn't write any review. And today when I ordered pan fried corn&amp; cheese momo, out of the 5 pcs ,one was pan fried chicken momo. A vegetarian person receives non veg item and that too during navratri. And also, today the boxes were not sealed. Really really disappointed. This is not acceptable at all??",

"Average. The darjeeling momos dont taste like ones found in darjeeling. So, please dont use the name",

"Quality has degraded within a span of months. Size is smaller and the outer layer is so thin, the whole thing just disintegrates.",
,
the delivery guy was so humble I don't know his name but may God bless him thanks bro,
,
"Worst momos I ever had. There was too much oil, Extra spicy, packaging was very bad.",

,
very bad taste. the sauce was nothing but chilli paste. any street shop would serve better than this. all the momos were not in single piece. very disappointed.,

"Worst experience, stale food with no taste. Horrible food.",
,
it was very tasty want to have more,
,
"The worst ever momos I have tasted. The taste was really not upto the mark. Apart from that, they only provide 5 pieces per dish whereas every other momo joint provides 6 pieces. . They dont even provide mayonnaise. Instead, they have a different chutney which wasn't any good in taste.. When asked about all these points, they had only one answer - ""Its as per company policy"".. I would never want to visit them ever again.",
,
"very bad, after order I called and told them always I getting broken momos, kindly check at the time of packing. but this time also the same thing happened.",

Paneer momo was worst - the paneer was bitter in taste . Waste of money . Neither received any sauces or u can say chutney with the momos ?? I had to eat the momos without chutney which was not even worth having and had a bad taste,
,
"the momos got cold and harder. otherwise taste would be good. and i didn't got any sauce with Moburg, but taste was good.??",
,
momos were nice. I didn't like that red chutney much. fillings was good. must try these chicken momos.,

"This restaurant is so big in place and lots of varieties of dishes are available here, I've tasted one of them, actually I tasted Veg Tandoori Momo which taste was too good..",
,
Last weekend I visited this restaurant and I tried a Chicken &amp; Cheese Pan Fried Momo which taste was absolutely brilliant guys.. I'm very happy.,
,
I have tried their some amazing dishes. The food was served in hot condition and it was super in the taste... Love this place . Highly recommended to Visit here now..,
,
Stuffing was undercooked. Found soil in the chutny .  Overall a bad experience. I have to think twice before placing my next order.,
,
I ordered this corn and cheese pan fried momos today i must say by way one of the best momo taste i ever had but it was little too spicy but apart from being spicy the taste was very unique and i simply loved it must try,
,
Wonderful presentation they have. And their foods are just nex lavel testy. Everyone should try their foods,
,
worst in taste . I ordered many times from navi mumbai kharghar it's best in taste fresh . this time it was worst .,
,
Horrible taste,

please check the package before sending,
,
it was under cooked!,

Again bread was burnt due to over cooking. Momos were undercooked. Will never again order from here.,

Why the chutney is thisss spicy?????. Blown mine tongue fullyyyy. Whyyyy!!!!!,

please send mayos as well,

Never expected such service from WOW! Momo,

"prompt delivery, nice behaviour",

I think you forgot for sauce with steam n fried momo,

Packaging was too hard to open. Perhaps use less adhesives to stick to the box.,

Please learn to follow the customer preferences. How difficult is it for a fast food joint to pack a chilled can of cold drink separately ?,

i requested to send complimentary myonnaise n extra sauce as well but restaurent did't send,

this people didn't give sauses and taste was not good,

"The offer of 99 for each item is good. . But the additional charges, delivery and taxes, completely spoils the offer and does not make it attractive",
,
The burger was fully soggy and all the sauce and mayo was spilled inside the box. The downside of the burger was wet and soggy. The fried momos were dripping oil and completely cold. Only good thing was the Pepsi can. Really bad experience.,
,
didn't provide pepsi,
,
No chutneys were given ... only momos were packet. Please take care while packing ??,
,
Pepsi was not given. It was mentioned I will get one pespsi. All 3 in 99. Why such offer if you can't comnit. Very bad service.  Not expected from zomato,
,
Please make sure nd be very careful about veg and non veg deliveries,
,
very slow food preparation... for just momos,
,
Thank you for giving the schezwan chutney with momos as I suggested before . . It was MOMOLICIOUS,
,
Very moderate in taste. Just like those momos which you can find in the street vendors in a price half than they offer. Chicken was not so good. . The Moburg didn't match the expectation and the filling inside was quite dry. They just gave minimal amount of mayo and sauce inside it. . I dont recommend this combo at all,
,
Bad experience .. too much garlic  and not properly cooked inside.. less material inside momos.. very cold and seal was also open..,
,
the food was stale and stinky. I ordered moburg and it was not fresh.,

momo was very bad and stiped,

"should give mayo instead of keeping it as an add on.. normally at store mayo is free with momo but while we order online, you guys are changing extra for it, which is not fair. it's better to get from other stores",

I have been a WOW MOMO! consumer since ages and for the first time I have experienced such kind of behaviour. A person named Hemant (that's what was written over his uniform) standing over the cash counter had a very rude attitude and behaviour. I was asking him nicely if they would skip the sauces from the momos and moburg to which he could have denied to me in an professional and appreciate way! I know the quality that they serve but it's highly inappropriate on their behalf to expect such an attitude orelse I would have rated them a 5 star!,
,
Tooo Took spicy,

tasty momos and speedy delivery by a polite delivery agent. very happy,

"The sauce was all over the packaging, hiw can one eat momos in such a way...",

Also the quantity was too less (5 pieces for ?110/-). . • Chicken MoBurg - this was better, had 2 fried momos inside, the bun was stale tho. . Bad dining experience, would not recommend this place.",

The manager's tone was extremely rude. I had to go all the way to the shop to remedy the problem. And while they did correct my order, the whole point of ordering from home was moot. . Anyways, remedy your attitude please. A polite behaviour goes a long way.",

"received lesser quantities of Darjeeling momo as per actual order placed, although food quality is good",

just make sure to not over steam momos so that it will be in its shape and easy to handle,

Neither the packet nor the individual boxes were sealed with tape. The inner lining of the boxes were falling apart. Thus compromises food safety and hygiene,
,
pipes missing,
,
Received smelling momos,
,
The whole garavy is spilled in the packet,
,
Swiggy?s service has become horrible. The foods is burnt,
,
I went for swechwan sauce however the food was too spicy to be eaten by a human.What sort of a monster cooks such food.The entire food went to dustbin as no human with taste buds can eat that.i tried calling restaurant but in vain.minus rating plz,

In one plate in place of 5 momos there are 4 momos and in another plate all the momos are mashed,

From the next time you send the food a little hot and if the test was a little better then what is better,
,
red chutney was nice,
,
Ordered Chicken moburg .The packaging was good .The delivery was on time.overall value for money experience.,

,
I specifically asked you to send pepsi and yet again you have send 7up. Highly disappointed,
,
Pepsi is missing this is not a way to order food,
,

,
moms sent are spoiled,
,
cold drink not servers.... totally disappointing,
,

,
delivery boy is superb.,

,
momos were not at par with regular deliveries.,

,
We had ordered two boxes of Chicken cheese momo. But were given only one.,
,
disgusting.....never order ......,
,
In love with pan-fried momo on offer days?? Fantastic taste.,
,
Everything was just awesome  and enough to fill ur stomach fresh and with a lot if stuffing the layer was so thin and the Momos were very juicy..amazing Momos and moburg is a must try..best Momos ever,
,
very good ??????,
,
"Momos was awesome, but chutney smell was very bad and without chutney how to eat the momos",
,
Should try it out..!! it was super tasty ??,
,
"Mushroom momo so much chili , can’t eat it. I did Oder without spicy ??",
,

,
I don't get my cold drink also teast was poor,
,
"It used to be very tasty.. now only bad food.. I ordered cheese corn momo &amp; chicken garlic sauce momo. Both are worst taste.. cheese momo tasted stale, and garlic sauce had only chilly no flavour.. now am thinking to waste money by ordering any food or not next time",
,
Wow delivery,

Pathetic experience,
,
I did not like the Moburg.,
,
taste of chuttny not good,
,
7up is not chilled atall. and also sauce got spilled,
,
spillage,
,
she is very  very  good,
,
worst momos that I have ever had. I would go for street momos from street vendors rather than spending so much on these kind of momos. presentation was good but the taste was not as expected. It was like eating raw spices and didn't even feel like having momo.,
,
i order 2oack of momo bt i received  only q pouch of sauce,
,
Mom's were nicely steamed and fresh. The chicken filling was nice.,
,
mayonnaise was missing..rest it was good and tasty,
,
The veg momo was stale and was smelling. It was ordered specifically for guests no one could eat it. Really bad experience with the veg momos.I wouldn't recommend the veg momos to anyone else.,
,
chicken cheese chicken pan fried momo was fabulous with a sweet smell of cheese. The moburg was not good like other times. Rest were as expected.,
,
I ordered fried momo combo but got steamed one.. it's really disappointing and the food is really cold not one percent of hot though the distance is just walking 15 min.,
,
"Who doesn't love momo?. . Especially when it's from @wowmomos . . I personally loved their momos, and therefore ordered a lot! They were also having an offer at Zomato, where everything was at 99/-. . I ordered:. . 1. Combo which had Fried Darjeeling chicken momo+moburg+pepsi. 2. Chicken cheese pan fried momo. 3. Chicken cheese fries momo. . The moburg was awesome! But the burger was a little dry.. . The fried momos were so hard, it hurt my mouth, I would've preferred them to be a little soft.. . The cheese was great!. . I love the pan fried momo, they were always my favourite but I'm a little disappointed this time . . Overall rating: 3/5. ",
,
moburg is awesome. fried Darjeeling momo was overcooked. there is no juicy or softness inside the crunches.,
,
all was good but I told repeatedly to send extra chutney and sauce for 4 packs... but only send 2 pouch of chutney..,
,
Momo was deeply fried. the taste was Missing. chicken filling was not found.,
,
The temperature of this momo is too low... kind of cold momo,
,
"Quality is not good, smelling inside of momo. it's not expecting.",
,
testy??????????????????????????????yummy??????????.,
,
bahut hi achha tha khane testing mujhe to achha hai,
,
It was an amazing experience buying this 199 combo. I ordered this combo twice and both the times I was totally satisfied with there service. Just want them to start delivering soon.,
,
I am a regular customer but really really  disappointed?? this time,
,
"momos were good, but the red chutney was sweet instead of spicy",
,
Badly packed! momos were open &amp; fillings spreaded out!,
,
Always get 2 out of 5 momos in smashed or semi smashed condition! Very badly packed!,
,
Not cooked properly and the flour base is like so bad in texture I never had this kind mono from wow momo before,
,
"They are established brand thus maintain a reasonable standard, every time you order, you get the same standard and quality. ",
,
". I was not tasty at all, I was decieved by the 'must try' tag in it.",
,
the chicken moburg was awesome.. it's so delicious ??????,
,
Awesome quality! No complaints. Got the 99 all offer for combos.,
,
1 combo pack was missing.. when I received my order at last night... very disappointing for me... and service was worst....,
,
"Chicken Fried Momo - good . Chicken Darjeeling Steamed Momo - fine, a bit bland. . ",
,
I ordered 2 Darjeeling momos and they sent 1.......,
,
bread was not fresh and the items  taste was not good,
,
Very less quantity I guess they sent half portion,
,
Two items in my order were missing. I want refund for this.,
,
veg momo was too oily but non-veg was good.. you can improve your veg momo quality,
,
Ordered Darjeeling steam momo but Wow Momo sent me chicken cheese steam momo. And Zomato quickly shed their responsibility casually denying any refund or replacement. What a waste!,
,
Ordered veg momo for the first time cause wanted to try how the Darjeeling Veg fried Momo tastes( as I have always ordered non veg). And I was surprised how good it tastes! the momo and the burger both! Loved it! ??,
,
taste good i chicken quality is also good. but only one person can have it,
,
"I ordered for cheese and corn momo. all I got chicken pan fried momo. this is third time, I'm having wrong delivery. highly disappointing.",
,
Sent burnt momos and even the preparation was burnt,
,
poor taste and cold food plesea  take him not a litle,
,
"I have order 4 burgers but receive only 2 piece, not acceptable, spoiled the moment as it was a surprise for kids",
,
old stock not fresh ........ the momos tasted weird,
,
do try thumbsup or any other drink other than pepsi,
,
spoon/fork not provided in veg Darjeeling pan fried momo.,
,
there was no taste of fried momos just the sauce :( disappointing,
,
"All momos except steamed ones, are made from a very spicy mixture...had ordered steam and tandoori momo plates but the tandoori momos were JUST NOT eatable, it was so spicy that it detroyed the entire palette...and mind you, not the onions etc, but the actual filling inside the tandoori ones!!. . Guys, please revert back to making the wonderful momos that you have always done and dont try and add senseless chilly to everything!!!",
,
unexpected poor service in sauce only chilly flaxes  sent,
,
4 momos in 180 I think it's expensive. momos being very reasonable in Gurgaon &amp; delhi. . they should see to their portion size.,
,
I ordered Chicken Pan Friend Momos and they delivered Veg Pan Fried Momos.......This is not a service expected .,
,
They have guve. Me distorted opened momo. Disgusting I was sick and hoping the food to be good the momo is soggy and like this,
,
"Momos where good as usual, tried the burgers it was just okay nothing great ",
,
"happy for customers, as long as your company doesn't go in loss ",
,
They deliver incorrect order and the Zomato will tell you to not place an order instead of taking complaint,
,
Good Taste. Yummy Momo's          Must try  Shezwan Chicken Pan Fried Momo's.,
,
"I had ordered for chicken momos but I got veg momos.. This is not fair, please do a refund or send a order for chicken momos",
,
"we ordered for pan fried momo with Tomato Garlic sauce, what was delivered was with Schezwan and too spicy to eat. Horrible taste too.",
,
"Want to give minus ratings as I am paying extra money and delivery and getting cold food, imagine having cold momos",
,
"WOW- Momo,. This is really WOW, excellent taste of Tibetan delight.. Delicious food, good service and situated in a very good place.. I ordered the Veg Supreme steamed momos and pan fried momos.. All the steamed momos pan fried momos are very tempting.",
,
"wow momos has came out with 17 different outlets across mumbail ,i made my visit at bandra outlet .they have a varieties of veg and nonveg momos. we absolutely loved the momos here, a little heavy on pocket but totally worth it .Tried various momos dishes but panfried with schezwan sauce and their sizzler  have my heart .A must visit place for all the momos lover out there ",
,
"Ordered wheat chicken steamed momos, it had 5 pieces and tasted pretty good. Liked it",
,
not that great in taste and also momos are very hard layer,
,
"chicken Darjeeling momo is really spicey and tasty , I really liked it",
,
The Moburg and the corn&amp;cheese fried momo was simply amazing!,
,
"only half order was delivered... I order for 2*2 veg moburg and 2* veg steamed momo(2 plate, 10 piece) but received only 2 veg moburg and veg steamed momo(2 plate, 10 piece) ",
,
Was expecting big taste by putting one day deal giving a shit food. de respect for the food .,
,
More spicy would be best for Momo. Please consider adding more spice,
,
Cheap and bad chicken. Pathetic food. Will give you food poisoning. I had enteritis after eating their momos and had to go to the doctors and get injected for stomach infection. Wow momo will make your stomach go wow and in not a good way !!!!!!!,
,
v.good.  ????????????,
,
Delivered item is completely spoiled. it's pics are attached .,
,
WoW Momos has always been good right from the start. The Momo Burger was something new I tried. Just a teeny weeny warning it's a lil hot and so is the red sauce. Use with caution. overall it's tasty.,
,
"the quality of the momo was not good...it was not soft, seems like prepared a long time before",
,
very poor quality of chicken used.. seemed like stale chicken being mixed in the momos.. Better to have from the street vendors,
,
I asked for extra mayo which was missing in the order and they even shamelessly added that to bill still. The momos were bland and tasteless. The moburg was decent rest was very bad,
,
They always give Schzewan chutney in abundance but always willingly try not to give the mint chutney dips for momos,
,
Excellent preparation and competitive price. Delicious.,
,
tasteless and pathetic . one should avoid it. definitely  not a WOW . Isse mat KHAO. .,
,
offering discount doesn't mean you can dilute the quality and taste. please please look into issues like these. couldn't eat at all.,
,
the veg momos smell funny .. a lil stale and the chicken momos r okaish in taste,
,
ordered pan fried momos but the momos were not fried.,
,
"the green chutney is very less quantity?, wear expecting more, and the Darjeeling stream momo was having a bad smell",
,
"I got momos in the moburg that was so hard that at first I thought it was a bone. For the pan fried, I got three momos where the filling was hard, felt like stale meat and one of the momos had stale slippery outer cover. It was such a disgusting experience",
,
very bad momos. extremely oily. it was not momos it was all oil.,
,
I didn't get my pepsi 250 ml they are not even taking calls from restaurant,
,
I ordered chicken momos and they hve send veg momos. I’m attaching the pictures.,
,
"awesome as always. the sauce with Darjeeling Momo is too hot , so a word of caution.",
,
They gave stale food. the momo's were rotten. they were stinking. horrible,
,
"the momos have a bad stench, they don't feel fresh. burger quality also poor. ",
,
I want my money back...,
,
Very less quantity in high price...Steamed momos were too oily and tasted like fried momos.Very slow service,
,
Wow momo is really wow.. quantity is an issue.: need to look into,
,
"A bit too oily , otherwise great taste",
,
Soup was not there.... eating momo without soup is like eating chicken without salt,
,
Why is it a Swiggy bill for an order via Zomato? Also the filling was not properly cooked,
,
I liked the taste. It was pretty good. I wish to buy more.,
,
very bad moms,
,
Tried pan fried veg momos. The momos were dipped in s spicy gravy and tasted great. . The momos were fresh and extremely flavourful.. Really enjoyed,
,
na,
,
waste of money... stale momos.. smelling so bad. yukk,
,
Panfried corn cheese Momo with tomato garlic sauce was quite tasty! Guys must try this!????,
,
Schezwan sauce is very sweet- I didn't like it...,
,
test is good,
,
the combo one was not good. it was dry and very less sauce and cream was given,
,
packaging is not good,
,
I ordered chicken schezwan pan fried momo but I ended up getting chicken cheese momos in schezwan sauce instead in my order.. . The taste was good but I would have given full stars if I had gotten my actual order.,
,
EXCELLENT ??,
,
Disgusting. Horrible spoilt and stale food was delivered. The smell was like one week old food. Horrible. And what a waste of money,
,

,
"good , next time need hot ",

,
"taste was awesome, loved it",
,

,
The delivery guy is exceptional he definitely needs a raise??!,
,
I ordered for steamed momo. I expected that in moburg also there will be steamed momo. but there was fried momo inside moburg.,
,
"I asked for veg steam momos, and they send me cheese corn momos.. not expected this from wow momos very bad experience.",
,
food was cold,
,
Ordered for 3 items but they delivered only 2 items and not also not responsive over the phone. Customer support also not able to resolve the issue. So please just beware before ordering from this restaurant,
,
good,
,
I have get only one can what type of this they are doing fraud,
,

,
Horrible packing and average taste. Roadside stalls make much better ones.,
,
2 momo fully burns and burger chicken was fully burns,
,
the red chutney doesn't taste good today.,
,
We didn’t receive dip  sad,
,
no taste in momos waste of money,
,
good,
,
"They gave only 4 momos in each box instead of 5. Don't know if the delivery guy ate those or it's a Wow Momos' fault. They didn't give enough chutney, just 2 for 4 momos boxes. ",
,
"chutney was just grinding of red chillies or nothing else no taste only chilly,,,, this wasn't chutney of wow momo and the green chutney wasn't in any of them...horrible experience",

,
testy,
,
I didn't receive any such with in the parcel no dipe was provided,
,
Foul smell. It was not freshly cooked and tastes like very sour.,
,
Always enjoyable - but now the green sauce is not being given,
,
Momom was Soggy. Schezwan sauce was not upto the mark.,
,
It’s second time that wow momos delivered wrong order. Instead of mild flavour chicken cheese which i had ordered they send just the opposite super spicy schezwan which I could hardly eat and had to throw away.,
,
"I ordered a seprate cheese dip,they missed it",
,
Moburg bread was old and tasted bitter. DO NOT ORDER.,

,

,
very good food love at esteem mall food court awesome??,
,

,
The person in charge of wow momo park Street is extremely rude and doesn't follow any cooking instructions,
,
"The sauce was way to spicy, was not able to eat it at all and had to eat the momos without the sauce. I have ordered multiple times and this time it's way to spicy",
,
need more protect our food. packaging need more strong.,
,
fantastic on time delivery. honestly didn't expect it,
,
it was sticky,
,
just amazing. loved it. fanatic.,
,
good taste but you also have to give schewan chutney with the burger otherwise I'm very Happy,
,
only received 4 pieces of gravp momo instead of 5 and no chili sauce given with steam momo,
,
For the 1st time such a bad experience.... unexpected service from Wow Momo Barasat...Momo was very  salty...taste was not upto the mark....even not properly prepared the shape....just waste of money ??,
,
taste is very pathetic and too oily,
,
"I asked for Schzwan pan fried, but I received with Tomato sauce",
,
the behaviour of delivery guy very nice,
,
stale food we got .. this is how they are serving thier customers.. worst experience ever,
,
Veg Darjeeling Steam Momo was stale.. Didn't expect this,
,
steamed momos were doughy and both the dishes were cold,
,
"very poor packaging, food leaked from the parcel..",
,
I really loved momos and being a momo fan they serve really nice momos??. Even the thukpa(chicken soup) is amazing ??,
,
"Momoi is ok but the Chutny was lost, Bad smells comes from it.. How can someone eat momo without it, Complete face loss in front of guest. ",
,
Wow Momo has been our favourite but today it wasn't fresh. stuffing was still okay but the Maida (outer shell of the momo) seemed rotten and smelling. Not happy.,
,
Chutney was spilled all over.... Highly disappointed. You should have done better job about the cutlery you are giving,
,
the served food was smelly and seems it was cooked few hours back so was not hot and fresh too,
,
"amazing taste as always, really enjoyed",
,
Smelling worst like they served old bad smells chicken  momos ..wastage of each penny on these worst momos which affects your health.,
,
i suggest pen fri momos try with sezwaan sause tomato garavy is not good,
,
good,
,
fantastic,
,
"foul smelling, got food poison. Did not expect this bad quality from Wow Momo.",
,
3rd class momo. Half fried and Pepsi is gone,
,
Amazing and must try!!. If you are looking for veg option then try this.,
,
Restaurant took longer to prepare order.. Packing was bad . Sauce of mono had spilled,
,
how do you eat even without a single sauce satchet?,
,
the taste of the food was good but it was very spicy,
,
good service,
,
the quality of the momo was really really bad and the chutney tast like expire,
,
The food was stinking like it was spoilt and rotted! Very bad experience! Will never order again …,
,
ALL TORN APART,
,
"On time delivery. Momo was delicious. . Served one person, Five pieces.",
,
try to do delivery soon. and hot food,
,
No sauses were provided,
,
chutny was bad,
,
"dear team, i ordered one plate chicken chilli momo.when i recived it was burnt. 4 pcs momo is eaten by my pets. i am very much dissatisfied. please do the needful. ",
,
I used Zomato for the first time.. Enjoyed,
,
The spice overpowered the taste of Momos...Packaging was pathetic.. sauce was all over the place... the box was celo taped evry where... Made a freakin mess... Pathetic in evry way... wasted my money,
,
Wow Momo is the best restaurant with the best staff. I totally loved the food. Staff is also very polite and actually listens to your requests. Very happy with the restaurant.,
,
I am so disappointed . the bread is totally burned !,
,
worst food full of oil and no tagging in veg and nonveg packets and veg and nonveg all moburg packed in one without any identity.,
,
I tried wow momos for the first time ever and I give 3 ?? for the whole experience.. So starting From packaging was was good but the taste and the price of the momos is not upto mark.. Even the chutney the serve is jus spice no taste at all the quality is good of the momos but the taste I dint like that good. So this was an okayish try..,
,
very good,
,
my all time favourite.. and I order it often. just addicted to it.,
,
"it has only 4 piece, i dnt knw in full amount they only give 4 piece",
,
corn and cheese momos were full of cheese and yummy.,
,
good,
,
Quality is not at all good with bad smell. Now it seems quality and standard of WOW momo and momo at Pavement of Jadavpur 8B bus stand are same. Price wise WOW momo 3 times than Jadavpur,
,
Did not received food that was ordered. Felt cheated. Check before receiving order from Zomato or Wao Momo. Both are thieves.,
,
"I recieved wrong item,means I ordered for 20 pieces and received only 10 pieces",
,
Bun was fresh and taste good. Only the green sauce was missing.,
,
the combo was pocket friendly and satisfying but the mayo dip was given at the side of moburg aalso in little amount,
,
Taste was good... Hot and fresh momos were served... But the price should be little less... In 209 rupees you will get only 5 momos... That means the cost of one momo is approx 42... And delivery charge alag se dena pdta h....,
,
"Chicken PAN Fried Momo's very tasty, yummy & value for money. Overall Good Food.",
,
the pepsi was not delivered and on chatting with the support team for over 30-40 mins no resolution was provided.,
,
steamed momos needs to me more properly wrapped... it spills all the stuffings.,
,
"I ordered 8 plates and restaurant delivered only 4 plates. This is pure cheating, I need a refund of my money ASAP! Wow momos HSR has a habit of delivering short orders, guys pls don't order from this outlet at all else you will end up losing money. ",
,
"I ordered Chicken and Cheese Pan Fried Momos but received Corn and Cheese Pan Fried Momos instead. Additionally, the restaurant did not care to even inform about this change in order.",
,
There was a chicken piece in the veg thumka soup. Not acceptable. I am vegetarian. ????,
,
"The food was hot and fresh, really enjoyed it. The sauces were on point.. Thanks!",
,
good,
,
very hard working person,
,
very nice,
,
missing mayo,
,
last time I ordered from wow momo was great but this time burgers are very dry no sauce no cheese very dry . very bad experience ????,
,
This chicken momo was not good taste also the the sauce was many days older i also complained but feedback also not good,
,
I ordered dargeeling veg momos ...overall momo's were good...but in chutney there were no garlic in chutney...u must add some garlic in it......n momo's without garlic chutney is worthless... so please add some garlic in your chutney it will taste better,
,
Choco- Yumm...??. Panfried- received tomato sauce ?,
,
Took one hour to deliver.,
,
Food was cold.,
,
more spicy,
,
had ordered moburger and Darjeeling momos. recieved burnt burger and soggy momos whose outer coating had opened up and the filling had come out.,
,
Some momo pieces tasted much sour.....so we didn't consume them,
,
rest all was great. it wasn't chicken cheese fried pan momos. it was chicken pan fried momo,
,
taste was good. price was ok. but the best part is i didn't fall sick after eating from zomato!,
,
Chicken momos are excellent.veg mom is average.its served with spicy red chutney,
,
excellent job,
,
"Disgusting, this is how they served me stale food leftover broken momos. All the spilling had come out. Don't accept order if you have to do this. ",
,
kandraaviya momos . vaaila vacha vomit vardhu,

,
my order got exchanged from someone else's order (veg chilli momo) from swiggy. That's right from swiggy. And when I contacted them they told that it's the mistake of the valet. But how can a valet from Zomato deliver a order from swiggy &amp; misplace it.. The bill even has Swiggy printed on it. But it has Zomato stickers on it,
,
Tasty,
,
Packaging was poor.,
,
"Good packing, fastest delivery, nice taste...me and my family liked it",
,
very bad,
,
Worst momos all were broken I wanted to fry and eat but everything was broken,
,
"I asked for garlic sauce, they gave schezwan sauce",
,
very good,
,
"first of all this is not fried momo, quality is very bad. if I order any kind of food from your place then you must be sure this should be good for health. but this is not. my Rs. 282/- gone. and yes my home is from your shop near about 2-3 mins on bike. please dont tell that 'jete jete thanda hoyebgache'",
,
please pack the food properly and please use a sause container for the fluids the food spilled completely,

The momos were really very tasty. Zomato valet was all drenched in rain while delivering it. We really felt guilty to have ordered the food during heavy rain. Thanks to the valet for delivering the food even in such heavy rain. I will give the restaurant and Zomato valet both 5 stars.,
,
Packing not so good.,
,
It was amazing ?? Very tasty ??,
,

,
Noodles was osm I see ever and chill paneer was osmmmmmmmmmmmmmm great food I see. ..................,
,
"all momoz are broke, it's is in Halwa Shape when delivered",
,

,
fried momo was full of oil,
,
Momos are supposed to be dim sums. That's small eats. But what I got was  five big momo like things wrapped and besmeared in some what tempered tomato ketchup !!!! This is cheating and insult to the customer.,
,
they have not provided sauce and cutlery,
,

,

,
lovely,
,
"very bad experiences, ",
,
The burger can be a little more juicy. it felt about dry. Everything else was good.,
,
The meal is incorrect- Momo is steamed and burger is veg and not chicken,
,
Testy,
,
Not fit for home delivery. . Took one hour and thirty minutes. Momo was cold already as a packaging wasn’t good.,
,
too bad,
,
No value for money as the portion size is too small.,

Packaging should be improved as it was steamed momos all were mixed into each other and got stick due to which all were broken and stiffing were out.,
,
I ordered  chicken pan fried schezwan momo they gave me veg one and i order veg steamed momo they gave me chicken.. That was funny part..but schezwan momo was too much spicy and its the bad part.. Other wise price wise thats fine..,
,
overall quality of the food was good but the preparation  time was too long... I got my delivery  after 1 hrs of placing order.,
,
moburg bread was not fresh.... and Darjeeling momo was good,
,

,
i did not found how the cost of momo charged from me Rs.245/- whereas bill was around Rs.150/-.including delivery charge. why this huge difference i paid. Have to think twice before placing order through zomato though i am a regular customer. explanation required.,

"This place is one of my favorite quick bite destination.. We ordered:. Cheese pan fried schezwan momo, fried Darjeeling momos, steamed chicken momo and chicken moburg.. Darjeeling momos and cheese pan fried momos are highly recommend. I think the moburg is not as it was before, the bun was dry and smaller.. Overall this place will provide you a good visit.",

Nice combo at 99. The only little complain I've is regarding the moburg the burger bun was burnt please make sure that you don't deliver such things because the taste of the moburg was absolutely ruined just because of the burnt bun . Other than that everything was perfect??,
,
delivery boy behavior is very good...he maintain his timing..very good job..god bless him..,
,
I didn't receive one combo in my order I was complaint also but still now not received,

"The sizes of the momo were very small. They are giving discount doesn't mean that you will lower your quality. I am a regular customer to wow momo, didn't expect to be this low this time. If you can't afford a discount then don't give one but atleast maintain the quality of the food. ",

Not satisfying,
,
The Momo filling is very good. Love the steamed momos. I personally feel momos should be fresh rather than frozen. . . Completely disappointed because there was no Chutney with the momos. This restaurant is famous for its chutney which is again very spicy. . . Selling variety is good but momo in a burger bun with chutney doesn’t makes sense. . . If you love extra spicy food I definitely recommend this restaurant. Pan fried is not for normal human.. . 4/5 steamed momos. 3/5 fried momos . -1/5 Moburg. . ?? ??/5 pan fried momos.,
,
A great place for momo with family. Staff is friendly nd good service. Specially chilli momo too ????.,
,
"too less in quantity, not even full plate as outside shops provide 10 piece per plate but wow momos provide 5 piece per plate...too short in plate size, pathetic ",

I have been craving the momos I had in Ladhak. I have tried a lot of momo places in Mumbai but they hardly match the taste of momos in Ladhak.. . Until…. I found this amazing place called Wow momos. They recently launched chilly momos and I had to try it. The wait time for chilly momos is higher (20 minutes) but it’s totally worth the wait. . . Really hot spicy chilly momos that will keep your tongue and eyes watering. Really close to the one I had in Ladhak. . . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,

no chutney with momos . no mayonnaise . nothing at all. not even picking call.,

worst and sauce was watery,

If at all you could mention the momos name on the box it would be easy to identify them when eating,

Wow momo is offering great offer of ?120 off you can get it at unbelievable price through this offer.,

Chicken Momo 2Quantities were missing.. Very Very Embarrassing????..,

amazing,

I have been craving the momos I had in Ladhak. I have tried a lot of momo places in Mumbai but they hardly match the taste of momos in Ladhak.. . Until…. I found this amazing place called Wow momos. They recently launched chilly momos and I had to try it. The wait time for chilly momos is higher (20 minutes) but it’s totally worth the wait. . . Really hot spicy chilly momos that will keep your tongue and eyes watering. Really close to the one I had in Ladhak. . . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,

inner stuff has bad smell and the packaging is very well.,
,
no green chutney and red chutney. worst packing too,
,
"Best soup I ever tasted, period. The packing was so good that not a single drop of soup got slipped and the soup was so hot that it taken me 10 mins to remove the lid. ",
,
raw momos very worse quality. .. didn't order from it,
,
All the things had leaked. They are charging so much money for packing and delivery. I expected better service. Nearly 100rs is for delivery and packing,
,
there was no sauce. how are u suppose to eat momo without sauce,
,
"The momo are filled with a lot of onions, it taste so bad. ",
,
"fried momo was very oily, oil was coming out of it.  I've thrown in dustbin. totally waste.",
,
"I ordered momos from wow moms and the momos was not upto the mark..and not satisfied my desire needs.. momos were coming out from the box and momo vegetable spilled outside the box.. i am attaching the image so that u can see how did you send the momos.. packaging was not good,plus momos taste was also bad.. I want my money back..",
,
"1st time I am so dissapointed on Wow Momos! I ordered 3 steemed Darjeeling chicken momos and 1 fried Darjeeling chicken momo, but After paying the bill we see we haven't. received 1steemed momo. Our money was wasted. No response from store even after calling. This is irresponsible and unethical to do this with food. Not ordering anymore. Wow momo has degraded it's quality and services both.",
,
they are shit. worse momos ever tried.. .............,
,
"received in smashed condition, monos were not in intact condition,  as well as received delayed",
,
"Did not provide the order full, the pepsi which was supposed to given with the momos.",
,
the skin of the momo was old and stinky. I don't want such things and I need my refund,
,
1. received the parcel with torn momos. 2. the order was for chicken cheese momo..whereas they had send us simple veg momos...no cheese..no chicken,
,
chutney had stale taste. momos were good but chutney had foul taste,
,
it's was  tasty and healthy ?? love the packaging,
,
Received broken momos ……………………………………………………………………………..,
,
They can send veg momos instead of paneer without updating you! Paneer momos were less so they send me 3 veg momos plus 30 rs mayo against the paneer momos!! Please do call customer rather than taking decision for us.,
,
i told them for extra chutney but they Send only one... and no taste at all,
,
I ordered veg stream momo.it was good but this time they don't give any chutney. momo without chutney ????????????,
,
"The chicken cheese chilli momos' taste wasn't as intriguing as I thought. In fact, it felt as if the momos were just dipped in the sauce &amp; presented.",
,
Ordered steamed momo and got fried momos so kindly refund since my taste buds got affected,
,
Packaging is poor. I have spillage issue with my burger. Poor,
,
the momos were less cheesy and too much salty. I did not like them at all. I don't think I will order again from this outlet. this is my second time worst experience.. Srirampur wow momos tastes much better.,
,
"The chicken cheese steam momos didn’t have good amount of filling. But they were tasty. 3.5/5.. . . Chicken darjeeling pan fried momos were just mouth watering. Sufficient, tasty, good filling along with authentic garlic taste! 5/5 ????",
,
Amazing packing and quality momos,
,
"very nasty taste, vegetables were undercooked as well.",
,
It was tasty and nicely packed. but one thing that I don't like is momos and sauce is packed in same box and it was mixed.,
,
not satisfied as per its name and fame,
,
Momos were delivered very late so they were no more hot and tasty,
,
very oily momos extremely unhealthy. need refund now.,
,
I wish they come up with sumthing where momos are hot when delivered,
,
They didn't give momo chutney and in one box they just splattered the chutney inside not good and the sauses in burger was not spread properly,
,
very bad experience.....I got previous day's food.,
,
"‘WOW’ Taste , On time delivery by Zomato, Won the Moment??, definitely recommended",
,
bad taste,
,
paneer fried momos are very oily.. i can actually taste oil in it.. and veg momos are all broken and the ketchups  with it are spilled,
,
I don't know why food was too sour to eat,
,
wow. just love this............................  .  .  . .  .   .,
,
increase quantity of momos atleast to eight...,
,
"excellent performance And Thanks for excellent performance,It Was A Good Preparation.. Absolutely True To Liking.. Best Wishes To The Restaurant. Thanks ??",
,
nice alwys,
,
one of the momo  had stone in it.....v dissappointed,
,
"Please do take care of the coupon codes , it disappoints sometimes, like it shows the coupon is invalid. I hope this  issue will be resolved soon.",
,
"food was absolutely pathetic momos were absolutely cold and rotten , not at all worth of money not even was worth a rupee . brands are making fool of us just pathetic like anything . thrown all food in dustbin ",
,
gave me chicken mo burger instead of veg mo burger.,
,
Good,
,
very bad quality and expired darjling momo waste of time in money,
,
poor packing all the chutney and food was flowing out,
,
"Rs. 99 deal was on, so tried again although past experience was not great, but considering this price I loved Steam Darjeeling Chicken momos and chicken Schezwan pan fried moms. Also learned not a fan of pan fried momos.",
,
very good,
,
Recently ordered their pan fried and steamed chicken momos and as usual loved it. Portion was good enough. Packaging was neat.,
,
momos were nice but portions are really small,
,
very good,
,
taste 3rd class please banned wow momo,
,
hope I can get my money back.  and I will make a video on your food quality.,
,
time taken,
,
quantity less. took too long to prepare and deliver,
,
"Worst momos ever had! Momos had a fusty oil smell, Cold drink was not cold &amp; the moburg tasted stale. Would recommend not to order from here even if they offer your free momos! I fell for their deal of the day scam.",
,
momo was very nice. the behaviour of the delivery man was excellent. very decent man..,
,
polite guy who delivered our food,
,
found a bug in the steam chicken momos. pic attached,
,
Glad to see the packaging??. Nicee taste also. Worth it to spend money,
,
I didn't like the augratin but their momos are really good.,
,
very bad food i ordered for the first time and i dont do again,
,
"I have a ordered a veg item from wow momo . They have been so casual with the order they a non non veg item . This has been a sheer negligence on their part! How can they be so casual !!! I am never ordering from wow momo now on. ( P.S. I am a strict vegetarian; even if i had not been , this is not acceptable.)",
,
souse is very bad it’s smelling so much what is this pls ckh and reply soon as possible,
,
It was tasteless,
,
one moburg is missing,
,
wrong products delivery,
,
when someone ordered both veg non veg both items then plz marked it..this again again u guys missed it.this too unprofessional behaviour.,
,
"The food delivered was absolutely cold. . Cold drink delivered was hot. . The delivery boy had to reminded to handover the hot coke aswel. . Inspite of requesting cutlery and tissues, nothing was sent. . Absolutely pathetic food n service.",
,
Pepsi was missing in my order.,
,
momos stuffing was not cooked properly seems uncooked,
,
If this is really the sight of your momos trust me all you can think of is how terrible they’d taste. Highly disappointed with wow momos?? Not recommended,
,
Could enhance the chutney it tastes bitter overall momos and mobung was good,
,
Highly satisfied,
,
ok,
,
the momo was only fried.. not pan fried. there was no gravy!!,
,
packaging is not good spiller food,
,
"Momos were not torn apart and package was not done properly, making it difficult to eat.",
,
Tasty ??,
,
Fast and smooth delivery,
,
It was spicy.. good but the shape was not that much fascinating and chicken was also little bit chewy... overall it was good,
,
nice,
,
it's very bad smell that's why it's 99 it's waste of money,
,
"Everytime order from wow momo 1-2 items are missing, never received a complete order",
,
very bad taste waste of money,
,
very bad smell r cmng from the sauce... very much disappointed... can't expect from this reputed company,
,
the momos were cold,
,
Experience was all over nice but there was less salt and flavour,
,
the food is not hot and not tasty. the chicken inside is not cooked well.,
,
the food delivered to me took 30 minutes to get ready and I was delivered cold food..not even warm..the food was completely cold.,
,
the food taste was bad sir and bad smell coming don't send food like this on this time it's very bad to say also why you people do like this who mad packed this food tell to enquiry why she has do like this,
,
wrong order sent knowingly,
,
I ordered four plates of momos but they only sent 2 plates.,
,
less sause provided. quality of food degraded.,
,
Momos were raw and not cooked properly. I ate only one of them as rest were not cooked properly,
,
Very bad quality. Cashier is overcharging and levying 18% tax on all foods (whereas it should have only been on momos). Too spicy and overpriced. Never visit it. The outlet was completely deserted. Now I know why.,
,
"the dip was not at all good. It smelled and tasted very bad. it was not fresh , some old leftover dip it seems",
,
momos are fantastic if u love spices.. as I am not a spicy food lover so I less star from my side otherwise momos ate really gud..,
,
it's smelling bad,
,
total kitna monos aata hai pacet,
,
They are big failure on reading orders…thought ZOMATO is taking care…but this restaurant has to really learn to read order send the correct items. I faced this problem 6 times in 2 years…which is very bad .,
,
"maza aa gaya khaa ke khatam, ik number cheez hai ye",
,
good,
,
I need that order to be repreated as it was cold momos,
,
"They never disappoint, love their momos! super awesome &amp; delicious??",
,
I order 2 plate of chicken momos and coming only 1 plate of chicken momos,
,
Great food great taste...Have tried momos at various outlets but this was really tasty..A must visit place for momo lovers,
,
please improve your quality.!,
,
Very very bad in taste very bad my experience is very pathetic ??????,
,
Ordered a darjeeling momo and a chicken momo. Received two chicken momos which were in pathetic state. Completely soggy and broken,
,
Too spicy. Chutney should be provided separately instead of putting it in the momos.,
,
tastyyy..yammmyyy,
,
First time ordered Darjeeling steamed chicken momos. Momos were so soft and nicely filled with chicken. Me and my mom just loved it. Thank you!??,
,
"Previous Day Chicken Momo, Bad Smell",
,
delivery service was ver good and fast Loved it,
,
Absolutely rubbish momos. The outer coveting was all uncooked and there a long hair strand all over the Momos. The order was delayed by 30mins. Despite that the quality of food was rubbish. Very disappointed!!,
,
too much spicy,
,
nice,
,
delivery boy very quickly and fast delivery my house...,
,
not bad,
,
feeling cheated,
,
it was bit colder. time taken around 1 hour to deliver,
,
"I have always been a fan of momos especially the steamed ones, they are light &amp; super healthy both as a snack &amp; meal!! . . Wow momos only emphasises on different varieties of momos, they have ranging from veg, non veg from spicy to sweet! Yes u heard it right they have super spicy momos with schezwan sause to dessert chocolate momos, they taste the best in every way!! . . Though I'm not a fan of fried momos, I still loved the taste there.. its value for money as they have a lot of combos that fits in everybody's budget. . . Guys its definitely worth a try whenever u r on brigade road, additionally they have some other small bites &amp; juices too!! ",
,
"worst experience of the day . it was sticky ,supercooled and was not easy to chew it.. ordering at home was not a good experience for moon ?? ",
,
Is this how we expect our burger?,
,
"not that great, the fragrance was unpleasant",
,
it was very very spicy ..we were not able to eat,
,
waste of money,
,
taste less,
,
Bakwaas taste and very less quantity,
,
Please added 6,
,
The chutney was not fresh...it was stinking,
,
Their staff is literally mannerless and don’t know how to tak to their guests. They are not even ready to help the customers. Seriously pathetic experience and I’ll mannered staff,
,
I received a cheesy dip when I asked for a mayp dip,
,
Received a cool order which made me upset,
,
Delivery was in time,
,
momo teste too bed. . filing too light sclpe too havvy,
,
"Inspite of regular follow ups and requests, Mr. Bile the manager of WOW MOMO stall, Diomand plaza mall, Nager Bazar. Did not sends cutlery or spoon every time i order.",
,
Smelly spooky momos disturbing and waste . Time to stop cheating customers selling spoilt food,
,
do you serve 5 momos worth 164? ?,
,
the momo was good,
,
yummy??????,
,
"Do not order on days when they give offer. Chicken was rotten, sticky and was stinking inside the momo",
,
good,
,
loved it..it was good..but the moburg should consist of more mayo and green sauce and red chilli sauce,
,
"""MG verdict"". . Butter Chicken momos - 4/5. Veg pan fried Darjeeling momos - 3.75/5. Veg chilli momos - 4.5/5",
,
"bad, broken , not happy with delivery . they should do proper packing ",
,
"it was good  , I like this taste also am impressed to delivery boys",
,
The chocolate momos were a lot better the last time I ordered them. Please make it the way you used to make it before.,
,
Amazing taste,
,
I order 4 momos  plates but I received one chutney  why ?,
,
You guys haven't mark which is veg &amp; which is non veg... Its difficult for us to find it out.,
,
The taste of the momos are delicious as I expected from husainganj outlet.. CHOCOLATE momo are also their best having the filling of brownie and chocolate sauce on the top are the yummiest momo.. Thank you hussanj branch you make my day .,
,
I ordered momo with 250 ml pepsi and I haven't received the pepsi,
,
I'm from darjeeling and this tasted nothing like darjeeling momos. Also there were chicken bones in the momos. minced momos shouldn't have any bones. also chicken was smelly and tasted stale. probably some leftovers from day was sent over and it wasn't freshly made.,
,
Quantity is less,
,
I asked for sweet chatni... not sent. . . momos are not fresh...,
,
"vomit,vomit,vomit. bad food",
,
"missed the rating for the delivery guy, but wanted to thank him for beautiful support",
,
if little bit extra sauce could be good,
,
good,
,
very bad quality.,
,
"In my order, expect the veg memo all packaging are open. no tissue paper in one piece all torn apart. Total mess. Didn't receive my previous orders in this shape.",
,
Love the food out here,
,
The momo and the burger both were cold.. and one of the tags of the packet was torn.,
,
pepsi was not chilled.??,
,
Nice,
,
it is wow momo original food  ? very very poor test.... very very bad experience with wow momo ......its horrible,
,
they delivered wrong order which is also incomplete without ie. without pepsi and moburg ????,
,
it is good,
,
"it was amazing.Burger was delicious as always but the pan fried momo stood out completely. Perfectly cheesy and yummmy, just how I lime it.??",
,
"I ordered cheese moburg, but there is no cheese in my moburg, plus its bad in taste and looks like sh*t. ",
,
Atleast half of the momos did not have chicken only onions…some had red colours on the momos. Did not like it.,
,
taste is so bad. I have not expected that type of teste from wow mom.,
,
Wow Momo never fails to amaze me ??,
,
"Had delicious tandoori momo today, great taste, great atmosphere, professional staff.. Good professional staff. Keep it up guys and maintain this quality.. ",
,
I ordered  two cheesy chicken moburg but they delivered me only one cheesy chicken moburg and another one is without cheesy and small size burger and also I PAID FOR BOTH  .very very bad ??,
,
Quantity is very less according to the cost for the momos,
,
The momos were stale. And it smelled a little.. hence i threw all of them.. I want a refund for these.,
,
rotten,
,
food is completely cold. please provide hot food.,
,
Chicken cheese chilli momo is the best one I've had from wow momo,
,
i didn't  get any sauce,
,
chatni is very bad in taste,
,
"i ordered 4 chicken moburgs. in 1 moburg, there was only the bread of the burger. no chicken. nothing. highly disappointed with this type of food and service. i need compensation. ",
,
They did'nt sent complete order. I ordered 2 qty of Veg Moburg Combo of 2 but the restaurant delivered only 1 combo. This is 2nd time similar mistake is repeated by this outlet if Wow Momo and i can't understand the reason why do they repeat this mistake,
,
"very very oily, quantity was good , packing was good",
,
I ordered momo in Zomato it come without minus the outlet manager didn't my call atleast once I tried 10 to 15 calls he doesn't pickup at least of my call very poor service I am totally disappoint especially the outlet manager I am not recommended this wow momo. people please don't waste your money and time.,
,
Quantity too small-unbelievable,
,
"Hello,. . We have ordered it from deals chicken Momos have raw taste of blood and not able to eat also sauce Is too much spicy totally waste of time and money please assist. . Regards. Saurabh ",
,
The momos used to be good at wow momo but that's a thing of the past now..  Fried momo is always sent over fried with oil dripping off.. Steam momo is not steamed properly.. Not expected from someone like Wow Momo you will get better momos at other restaurant in Serampore.. Not recommended at all please don't try momos from WoW Momo which is it was known for but that's history now.. I've had repeatedly received orders with quality issues.,
,
it was absolutely fun,
,
i was expecting fried crips momos and chutney separate packing. this stuff what you sent was unacceptable. vey much similar to steam momos. wasted me 250 bucks. . thanks. akash. 8108225165,
,
"No lettuce , a very little quantity of sauce and mayonese. Disgusting",
,
"Today for whatever reason, the food was cold and the cheese became hard and the entire thing was very dry.. Disappointed. ",
,
"I was craving momos for many days but due to Shravan, I couldn't order. When I finally decided to order, I got Momos &amp; Moburg Combo of both Veg &amp; NonVeg. I loved the taste of the Momos and Moburg and the combo was the best. They offer lip-smacking kinds of momos at the best price. One moburg and 4 pieces of momos I found enough to fill my stomach for lunch. I was so hungry and eager to eat that I couldn't even wait to take a picture of it.??",
,
very tasty food ?? and fast delivery. They accommodate all requests when preparing the order which is nice,
,
Delivery person did not have change was not able to track my location even if in the map location was correct. Was giving lame excuses. I don't comment about delivery person much but he needs a bit more training.,
,
there was no chillie sause very bad service,
,
Corn &amp; cheese momos are our go to frequently in the evenings since we discovered it. Never disappoints. Simply great!,
,
momos has foul smell and become stale,
,
I like the cheese one better. thank you,
,
yes the momo was stale .,
,
Momo was served without chutney. Chutney should accompany along with the momos and not to be included as add ons.,
,
momo was good taste was ni,
,
"The momos were already rotten and was stinking.,.this was not acceptable never gonna order from this wow momo store. poor service  ",
,

,
Loved the food here...nice place to eat out........ . Momos were tasty. Tastes good momos after a long time,

I ordered pan fried darjeeling chicken momo bt they give steam darjeeling chicken momo.,
,

"Quality is amazing, timely Service and great packaging but prices are a bit higher DELIVERY Service is good.",
,
Wow! Momo,
,
The food was cold.not packed properly at all.please make sure that the boxes are properly covered and packed.,
,
darjeeling momo is so yak,
,
The quality of the food was very poor and we fall sick after consuming it.,
,
"Burnt food served.. Also the buns were not fresh, they hard and burnt.",
,
It was so sweet in taste I don't know why. wow momo has always delivered products with best quality but this time it was too bad,
,

,
Currently the taxes are huge... which is becoming very difficult for us. Please lower the taxes on food. Plus there is delivery charges.,
,
"Ordered chicken steamed wheat momos, received Maida momos....very bad",
,
This is the second time that the corn cheese momos are served in such a disgraced manner. The momos were practically fried and had oil and crumbles of it oozing out of it. They were so bad that it tasted bitter and had to be simply discarded. Wow Momo seems to be losing it by the day and customers are being taken for a ride.,
,
wonderful,
,
Little Spicy but taste good,
,
taste was horrible as there was too much sauce added. Also crisp was totally gone due to sauce was on momos.,
,
cool food,
,
momos were good but I did not receive the cold drink I ordered,
,
Filled with chilly... hardly any chicken.. momo s are stiff. very bad.,

the Schezwan sauce of the pan fried momo was too sour..felt was old and not fresh,

Amezing ??,

,
"Amazing place to chill with friends. The food is amazing. Must visit. Special deals on Wednesday and Thursdays, by the way!",

,
Absolutely amazing food quality and staff are super nice . Food and moms super delicious.. Great place..,
,
The Moburg was wow. It taste so good that I can't express. Really just love? it. Just go for it.,
,
I loved the crispness of fried momos. paneer and cheese corn momos were great but best was darjeeling momos! would def order that again! packing was okay too. would enjoy more if they had given cheese sauce along w momos ;),
,
Horrible chicken .Pls take it back not worth to eat .,
,
Great,
,
the momo tastes sour.,
,
add mayonnaise,
,
overall experience was good ..I m cutting one star because I got double chicken cheese momo instead of chicken fried one.otherwise very nice.,
,
3-5,
,
Why will you ever serve hot coldrinks are you an idiot? They are named “cold drinks” for a reason. Sucha mood spoiling experience,
,
"worst food delivered moburg was burnt , and packaging is disgusting all the sauce and mayonnaise came out from the moburg and all over the box and packet.",
,
Packaging was pathetic.. all pan fried momos were too hot. Average taste.,
,
very tasty,
,
ordering here is money waste,
,
Excellent,
,
OMG pan fried chicken dargeeling momos are my new favourite ??????????,
,
Momos are cold and looks stale,
,
"chicken darjeeling steam momo costs around 99 and only chicken steam momos cost 129 rs.  i ordered previously chicken darjeeling steam momo  on different occasions but today after tasting only Chicken steam momo which nothing special than simple darjeeling chicken steam momo, completely copy of that. Then why r u charging more for only chicken momo without darjeeling tag. This is fraudulent activity which is not expected atleast from wow momo. The flour is also bit sour in taste due to adding excessive vinegar into it most probably. i'm totally disappointed with wow momo.",
,
Guys do not order. Stale momos provided. Wasn't expecting this from a brand like wow momo. Heated stale food to high temp and delivering.,
,
excellent,
,
Over dose of sauce,
,
I need a refund,
,

Not so tasty momos. I could feel only the dough. One big draw back was that the red sauce was just poured on one side in the box. By the time I got it then the sauce was flowing between all the momos in the box! Also the sauce was not upto the mark! A big no!,

I ordered the darjeeling momos and chicken steamed momos. . The chicken steamed momos were normal like normal chicken momos.. . The Darjeeling chicken momos were yummy flavorful. Had big pieces of ginger which was not good cause the big pieces of ginger were coming in the mouth. Otherwise it tasted awesome just like a warm chicken stock soup very comforting and tasty.. . There were 2 chutneys green and a red garlic chutney(schezwan sauce sorts) but it was way to spicy for my liking. Yes I knw the sauce with the momos is usually spicy however this was so spicy my mouth was on fire and I couldn't eat the rest of the momos for about an hour till things got back to normal. I had to wait or wouldnt get any taste as all. It basically numbs ur tongue and lips.. . The green chutney was spicy too. so enjoyed my momos plain.. . In terms of packaging the packing was good and food was sealed properly. Only wish they had labelled which was chicken momo and Darjeeling chicken momo for better understanding.. . All in all good momos,

The momos were burnt and the sauce was just ground chilly. do not give offers if you guys are not ready to serve. it's better you don't give at all than give such sub standard food which you can't even eat. we can only throw this to dogs,

The burger was excellent but the steamed momos were totally bland the sauce was only spice no garlicky or salt so reduced one star.  Pan fried we’re great just a little tangy due to tomato sauce but good overall,

worst experience of momo. never realised momos can taste that bad.,

the size of momo has drastically reduced and the quantity of stuffed chicken is also very less compared to last year,
,
"They delayed my order for a very long time, and then accepted it ( so then I’d have to pay penalty if I cancelled it ) food was great ( not warm but okay ) sauce with it was nice too",
,
pls return this,
,
Good food. Great taste,

I ordered 3 Chicken Cheese fried Momo and all 3 of them were sent in a mixed way (plain chicken momo and only some chicken cheese momo) . If the momo was out of stock they should have called and cancelled the order instead of charging me Rs 613/- and sending this.. . Highly disappointed as this was my favorite momo place !!!,
,
overall good.,

The restaurant didn't handled the whole order to the delivery agent and only half of the order was delivered... Mistakes from both Restaurant and Delivery agent's end.,

I had ordered for chicken family combo which was mentioned as 15pcs of momo and 3 moburger and 500ml Pepsi. but I received only 3 moburger only. this is outright cheating. zomato take action and boycott wow momo,

,
Nice Momo... hot and fresh to home ...Enjoyed the momo taste,
,
Not hot it was chill,
,
food was nice but delivery was so complicated!,
,
"I placed an order from the Wow Momo's Korum mall outlet and the order was accepted by the restaurant. While placing the order, delivery time was estimated at 55 mins. After waiting for 45 minutes, a Zomato representative called to inform me that they had to cancel my order because the restaurant was not responding to repeated calls tried by the delivery person and the representatives. This is highly irresponsible and unprofessional on the restaurant's part. Being a franchised chain and apparently a ""Quick Service restuarant"" they were not able to prepare the order nor inform the same on time. The refund for the same was generated by Zomato. I'm disappointed in the quality of work and professionalism presented by the people at Wow Momo's, Korum Mall and I hope nobody else has to go through the same difficulty. It was a complete loss of time, energy, efforts and appetite.",

So delicious ????,

5 star review ........................................................................................................,
,
I recently tried this new range of chilli momos introduced by wow momos. They were very spicy and flavourful. You can try it for once if you're spicy lover! . The only problem was that they didn't provide any sauce or chutney with momos. I even asked for it but they said chutneys are not available with these momos.,
,
useless service it took more than 90 mins for my package to arrive.,
,
Wrong order,
,
very very poor,
,
"No sauces chutney provided, also no tissues, chilli momo not as shown in image, not saucy, very dry than pan fried",
,
98 rupees delivery charge. Definitely not worth if I add that (obviously),
,
they give us raw momos all raw kacchaa maida not steamed very highly disappointed,

"I placed an order from the Wow Momo's Korum mall outlet and the order was accepted by the restaurant. While placing the order, delivery time was estimated at 55 mins. After waiting for 45 minutes, a Zomato representative called to inform me that they had to cancel my order because the restaurant was not responding to repeated calls tried by the delivery person and the representatives. This is highly irresponsible and unprofessional on the restaurant's part. Being a franchised chain and apparently a ""Quick Service restuarant"" they were not able to prepare the order nor inform the same on time. The refund for the same was generated by Zomato. I'm disappointed in the quality of work and professionalism presented by the people at Wow Momo's, Korum Mall and I hope nobody else has to go through the same difficulty. It was a complete loss of time, energy, efforts and appetite.",

The guy did billing for two plates when I ordered one clearly. Before payment i objected for the amount because i guessed it is high price for one plate still he never explained that he billed for two plates. He could have adjusted with the subsequent offline order which he got but he made more confusion to make sure that this doens't happen. Later he gave me two plates of hardly cooked momos with uncooked corns inside and paper pieces hidden in gravy. They don't value others money at all. Good luck if you still wanna give a try.  .,

"I have been a wow momo customer for a long time, this was the first time I visited Kurla's outlet and oh god, pathetic food and even more pathetic staff behaviour. There was a short hair inside my momo and the lady at the counter was rude enough to say that it can be yours, I mean seriously? Firstly that's a gent's hair secondly it was clearly inside the filling and then you have the audacity to talk like that to your customer! Pathetic experience, worst momos ever. Never going back to wow momos and neither recommend anyone going there. Even a roadside momo stall is more hygienic and if not they are not rude or inappropriate to their customers. Extremely disappointed.",

"Momo tastes good. But taste isn't the primary factor here. These are not authentic momos. The integral part of a momo time is soup and its missing. No one loves to eat dry momos. I can remove bhaji from pav bhaji by making pav more tasty that can be eaten raw and add some potato fried mash in the pav to make it a delish but serving it saying its pav bhaji is a fool's job. Its a burger now actually or vada pav but not pav bhaji. Stop calling your momos as momo if you dont serve the traditional and much required soup along with it. I mean what are you charging ?159 for then? Just 4 pieces of momo? I have had better tasting momos @ ?40 and they serve 6 pieces. So if you wanna actually get customer's attention, then dont try killing traditions. Just aiming for veblen good approach doesn't make every brand Apple??. Most brands lost a fortune trying to follow the same without market research",
